<h3>IN THE NICK OF TIME</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Old Dave Hinch awoke with the bitter
trickle of smoke in his nose; and his first
idea was that he must have fallen asleep with
his pipe in his mouth, lost his grip on it and
set fire to his beard. That appendage, and
the whiskers and mustache which mingled
with it, were dear to him; and rightly so, for
they covered everything of his face except
his nose and eyes and receding strip of brow.
So he clapped a hand to his beard even before
he sat up, and opened his eyes. Beard and
whiskers and mustache were all there, and
all right. Reassured on this point, yet still
distressingly conscious of the tang of smoke,
he hoisted head and shoulders from the pillow
and opened his eyes. The room was in utter
darkness, for the blinds were down. With
fumbling hands he struck a match, and lit the
lamp which stood on the chair beside the bed.
Then he saw something—the same thing that
he had smelled—a thin, bluish haze in the
close and chilly air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Dave Hinch forgot all about his whiskers,
and leapt out of bed with an agility which
belied their venerable hoariness. He slid his
legs into trousers and jammed his bare feet
into boots and jumped to the door. He
snatched it open, admitting a stifling roll of
smoke which instantly enveloped him. He
retreated, slithered across the bed and dived
to the nearest window. He tore town the
blind, threw up the lower sash, and thrust
forth his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smoke oozed out past his shoulders into the
cold starshine. He yelled “Fire! Fire! Help!
Help!” at the top of his voice until his throat
ached. He got no response. All his neighbors
were sound asleep, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He withdrew from the open window and
saw the draft between door and window had
extinguished the narrow flame of the lamp.
He stumbled and fumbled his way to the door,
through choking swirls of heavy smoke. He
sank to his hands and knees and looked down
the narrow staircase with smarting eyes. He
saw a lurid, pulsing glow away down, behind
swirling depth of hot and acrid fumes, and
whisperings and cracklings and a sound like
the snoring of many sleepers came up to his
stricken ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crawled back to the window, and again
set up his desperate outcry. But all the inhabitants
of Forkville were sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stranger arrived at Forkville at 1:20 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span>,
Tuesday, February the tenth. He carried a
light pack on his shoulders, and his snowshoes
atop the pack. The road was good.
He topped a rise, rounded a sharp elbow of
second growth spruce and fir, and saw the
covered bridge, the village and the white
fields laid out before him in the faint but
enchanting light of frosty stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like an illustration for a fairy-story,”
he said; and just then he became aware
of the fact that something seemed to be wrong
with the charming picture. The fault lay
with the nearest house of the village. Smoke
arose from it, white as frosted breath, and
lurid gleams and glows wavered and flickered
about its lower windows. He paused for a
few seconds, staring, strangely horrified by
the sight and the thought of a dwelling blazing
unheeded and unsuspected in that scene
of peace and fairy beauty. Then he ran. He
went flying down the short dip and through
the tunnel of the barn-like bridge, and, as he
slackened his pace on the rise beyond, he
heard old Dave Hinch’s frantic yells. He
recognized the sound only as a human cry,
for he did not know Hinch or the voice of
Hinch. He responded with an extra burst of
speed—ignoring the slope—and with a ringing
shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger soon spotted the window from
which the yells issued. A minute later, by
means of a ladder, he rescued the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then three of the villagers arrived on
the scene. They had been aroused from their
slumber by the stranger’s shouts. They
looked at Dave, then at the stranger, then
back at Dave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Joe?” asked one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s lower jaw sagged. He
pointed at a window, an upper window of the
main house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon Joe’s still abed,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neighbors swore. The stranger ran
to the ladder, flopped it across and along to
the window indicated, cast off his pack, and
ascended like a sailor or a professional fireman.
Upon reaching the window, he smashed
glass and thin wood with his double-clad
fists. A thin reek of smoke came out. He
wound his scarf about his throat, pulled his
fur cap down over ears and eyes and went
head first through the shattered window.
Down at the foot of the ladder, Dave Hinch
cried out at sight of that destruction, and one
of his neighbors cursed him for a fool and
worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger picked himself up from the
floor of the dark room into which he had
plunged. He couldn’t see anything, and the
air was deadly with heat and smoke. He
turned and kicked what little was left of the
window sash clear out of the frame. Turning
again, he dropped on his hands and knees,
and went in search of the bed and the unfortunate
Joe. The bare floor was warm. He
found the bed almost immediately by bumping
his head against the wooden side of it.
He got to his feet, reached over and felt a
human figure in the bed. He pulled it toward
him, sheets, blankets, and all, clutched
it to his laboring breast and made for the
window. He was thankful that Joe was a
lightweight. He found one of the natives
at the top of the ladder and passed his unconscious
burden out to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he is,” he shouted. “Dead, I shouldn’t
wonder. Asphyxiated for sure. Take
him home. Get a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned far out the window, gasping for
clean air. As soon as the ladder was clear
he slid to the snowy ground, recovered his
pack and snowshoes, reeled and fell, then
crawled dizzily away from the burning house
in which he had lost all interest for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger crawled to the high road,
turned there and looked back at the scene of
his humane and disinterested exploits. He
saw that the house was fated. All the lower
windows within his field of vision belched
smoke and flames. The ell from which the
old man had escaped was blazing to the eaves.
There was no wind, and the smoke went
straight up. A dozen or more people now
ran aimlessly about in the glare, or stood in
helpless groups. The old man’s voice still
rang above the roaring and snapping of the
fire, cracked and raspy. No one paid any attention
to the man who had performed the
rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger moved up the road, glancing
right or left at each house as he came to it.
The village was of the simplest possible design—two
lines of dwellings and stores and
snow-drifted front yards facing one another
across the white high road. Behind the
houses and stores on both hands were barns
and sheds, a few white-topped stacks of straw,
and snowy fields climbing up to the edges of
black forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger had not gone more than halfway
through the village when he spotted the
thing he was looking for, and turned to his
left off the road. This was a building two
and a half stories high, square, hooded in
front with a narrow veranda and an upper
gallery, and flanked on the right with an impressive
extent of attached sheds and stables—all
in need of paint. By these physical
features, and by its general aid of rakish unconcern
of public opinion, it proclaimed itself
the village hotel. The stranger stepped up
onto the worn flooring of the veranda, which
snapped frostily to his tread. He saw, dimly,
antlered heads of moose and caribou on his
right and left, out-thrust from the clapboarded
walls, as if the monarchs of forest
and barren had been imprisoned in the house
and were now making their escape without
wasting any time in looking for the door.
He was not intimidated, for he had seen the
same style of decoration in this province before.
He crossed the veranda, and hammered
on the door with his mittened fist. The
door opened in half a minute, disclosing a
tall man with a blanket draped about his
shoulders, a lamp in his hand and a stoop in
his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s all the row?” asked the man of the
house. “I heared hollerin’, didn’t I? Or
was I dreamin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t dreaming,” replied the
stranger. “There’s a house a-fire, down near
the bridge. Have you a room for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say so! Whose house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I’m a stranger here.
Good-sized white house with an ell, first
on your right heading this way from the
bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Dave Hinch’s!” cried the other exultantly.
“Hope it catches Dave himself,
darn his measly hide! But step inside, mister,
an’ shut the door. I’ll go git into some pants
an’ things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the lamp went swiftly up a
flight of uncarpeted stairs, with the stranger
at his heels. He entered a bedroom; and the
stranger was still with him. He dropped the
blanket and dressed with amazing speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t be in time to save it,” said the
stranger. “The whole ground floor is a-fire
and roaring. A chemical engine couldn’t
save it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save it! I don’t want to save nothin’. I
want to watch it burn. But say—did you
hear anything about Joe? Did Joe git out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I got Joe out myself—unconscious.
And the old man, too—but he was all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old man! You went an’ got him out?
Hell! Say, it’s easy to see you’re a stranger
round these parts, mister. Well, I’m goin’,
anyhow. Maybe I’ll git a chance to push him
back into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what about a room for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A room? Sure you can have a room.
You’ll find plenty right on this floor. Help
yerself. Here, you can have the lamp. See
you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust the lamp into the other’s hand,
fumbled his way down the dark stairs, and
dashed from the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first room into which the stranger
looked, shading the lamp with his left hand,
was already occupied by someone who snored
in a high and rasping key; the second was occupied
by someone who instantly inquired
“Who’s that?” in a feminine voice; but the
third was empty. It was also cold and large
and dreary. He examined it carefully by the
feeble light of the smoky little lamp, and came
to the conclusion that it was a room of state,
a chamber of pride. There were white curtains
looped at the windows, with dust in their
chilly folds. There was a carpet on the floor
with a design in yellow and red which seemed
to jump up at you and wriggle. There were
several chairs of several designs and shapes,
all upholstered in wine-red plush. There was
a small center-table with a marble top and
walnut legs, and on it stood a tall vase full of
dusty paper flowers. There were several
framed pictures on the walls. There was a
bed with a high headboard of glistening yellow
wood. There was a little open-faced
stove of iron and nickel. Its open face was
filled by a large, dusty fan of pea-green paper.
Beside it stood a dusty basket full of short,
dusty sticks of rock-maple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger set the lamp on the center-table,
lowered his pack and snowshoes to the
carpet, cast off his mittens and muffler and
cap and went over and gave the bed a second
and closer inspection. He removed the lace-edged
pillow sham, which was coated with
dust. He shook up the pillows and turned
them over, then opened up the bedding for
inspection and airing. Returning to the stove,
he started a fire with the help of the paper
fan and paper flowers. The dry maple caught
and flamed as if by magic. He discarded several
outer articles of clothing, pulled one of
the fat chairs up to the stove, and slumped
into it; filled and lit his pipe. And thus the
tall man with the stoop found him half an
hour later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you be,” said the man of the house,
with a grin. “You chose a good one, that’s
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first one I came to that wasn’t already
taken,” replied the stranger. “How’s the
fire? Hope you didn’t carry out your murderous
intentions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t carry out a danged thing. The
roof’s fell in. And say, if you want to see a
man real mad you’d ought to see Dave Hinch.
I’d of paid five dollars for the show if it
wasn’t free. But about this room, mister.
To-night don’t count, for I ain’t such a hell of
a business man as all that—but if you stop in
it it’ll set you back one dollar an’ fifty cents a
day, or nine dollars by the week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty good rent for a room in the country,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rent? Well, I throw in three or four
meals a day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case, consider me as a fixture for
weeks and weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That suits me, mister—but what’s your
name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vane,” answered the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vane,” returned the other. “Then you’re
not from hereabouts, mister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m from New York—and other places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? Well, I reckon I’ve read it in
the newspaper. My name’s Jard Hassock,
an’ I’m the proprietor of this here hotel,
which is known far an’ wide as Moosehead
House.” He pulled up a chair and sat down,
then leaned over confidentially. “Maybe
you’ve seen Strawberry Lightnin’?” he
queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—but I have heard of her,” returned
Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bred her,” said Hassock with a rapt look
in his eyes. “Bred her, owned her an’ trained
her. And the Willy Horse! He was her sire—I
owned him, too. His dam died when he
was only four days old, an’ I got him cheap
an’ raised him on a bottle. He was the best
horse ever bred in this province, an’ then
some! Sold for twenty thousand—but that
wasn’t the time I sold him. Oh, no! Four
hundred was the price I got. Can you beat
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds tough. I’ve heard of the Willy
Horse, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a wonder! But I didn’t have the
chance to try him out like I did the mare.
She was good! Her mother was a little bit
of speed I got in a trade up to Woodstock.
She was sure a winner, that Strawberry Lightnin’!
I raced her two years, an’ then I sold
her for a thousand. Had to do it. It ain’t
the money you make that counts in that game,
but the money you spend. I’m content to live
quiet enough here in Forkville, but when I’m
racin’, an’ away from home an’ the like of
that, mister, the Derby winner couldn’t keep
my pockets full a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane yawned and quickly apologized for
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’d best be goin’,” said Hassock, rising
slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sleepy, I must admit,” returned Vane.
“Out all day in the fresh air, you know.”</p>

<h3>JOE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>After a deep and dreamless sleep of seven
hours, Vane opened his eyes and beheld
Jard Hassock standing beside his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister, you’re a wonder!” exclaimed Jard.
“I didn’t get it all last night, we was that busy
runnin’ round pertendin’ we was tryin’ to put
out the fire, jist to fool old Dave—but Tom
McPhee’s been here this mornin’. What d’ye
say to ham an’ aigs an’ hot biscuits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In ten minutes I’ll show you,” replied
Vane, sitting up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you stop right where you are,” returned
the other. “I’m fetchin’ it on a tray—an’
proud to do it! Say, Tom’s told me all
about how you flopped that ladder over an’
skun up an’ div head first through that window!
It was Tom McPhee you passed Joe
out to. A cool head an’ a cool hand, mister—an’
them’s things I admire. Tea or coffee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was easy,” said Vane. “There was no
danger. How’s Joe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine an’ dandy this mornin’, but ten minutes
more of the smoke would of done the
trick, the doctor says. Did you say coffee, or
tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coffee, if it’s the same to you, thanks very
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hassock went, but was back in ten minutes
with a large tray loaded to capacity. Later he
even fetched a pail of hot water, then returned
to the kitchen, leaving Vane to his own devices.
He sat down in a splint-bottomed chair
close to the kitchen stove, and lit his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s him,” he said to his sister. “He’s the
very identical lad we heard about who stopped
a week at Wilson’s camp an’ washed himself
all over in the little rubber bathtub you could
fold up an’ put in your pocket. It’s him. I
kinder guessed it last night. His name’s
Vane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s no harm in a bath,” replied
Miss Hassock. “A good wash all over never
hurt anyone, that I’ve ever heard tell of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But three in one week, Liza!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of it, so long’s he had the time
an’ didn’t catch cold? Now if it was only
summer time an’ the pump was workin’ an’
the pipes wasn’t all froze up, he could use
the bathroom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he sees it he’ll maybe stop till summer
time jist to try it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. What’s brought him to Forkville,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ask him, Liza. I’d like fine to know.
Whatever brought him, he come jist in time
for Joe Hinch, that’s a sure thing. He’s a
cool hand, whatever he’s after; an’ he knows
how many beans makes five, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was he doin’ out to Wilson’s camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snoopin’ ’round in the woods all day an’
swappin’ yarns with the boys at night, that’s
all, far’s I ever heard. He paid for his grub.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard Hassock was a bachelor and Liza was
a spinster. Liza was tall, large-boned and
large-featured, square-shouldered, mannish
looking and ten years Jard’s senior—sixty
years of age, if a day. She was straighter
than Jard, who suffered from a chronic rheumatic
crick in the back. She was level-headed,
extraordinarily capable—and extraordinarily
soft-hearted. She could do anything outdoors
or in, from plowing sod to whipping cream,
and do it right. Her hand was light and sure
at the cooking, and light and sure on a horse’s
mouth. Her knowledge of horses was as
great as Jard’s, and her ways with them were
as wise as his, but she never said so, and he
never thought so. Jard didn’t know that she
was his guardian and his manager; he didn’t
realize that he would have been cheated out
of his very boots years ago but for her; but
other people knew these things and stood in
awe of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane appeared in the kitchen a few minutes
later. He bowed to Miss Hassock, and
thanked her for the breakfast, making special
mention of the coffee. Jard had his eyes on
Liza, though she was not aware of it. That
was the way with Jard. One either did not
feel his glance or did not heed it, for it never
suggested a search for anything more important
than a humorous point of view or intention.
A great joker was Jard Hassock in
his own dry way; but the fact is that he looked
at life and people for many things beside
jokes and could see them as quickly and as
far as the next man. And now he saw that
Liza was pleased with the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go fetch my pipe, an’ then I’ll show
you around outside,” he said to the guest, and
presently they were sauntering in the direction
of the stables. Here were six open stalls
on one side of the floor and two box stalls and
a room devoted to harness and oat bins on the
other. Only two open stalls and one box stall
were occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a time when I had two work
teams an’ a roadster, an’ a bit of speed in every
box,” said Jard. “But I’ve cut down the
farmin’ of late, an’ I’ve quit breedin’ an’
racin’ altogether. Twice stung, once shy—that’s
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane murmured something sympathetic,
and examined the two medium-sized, elderly
farm beasts in the stalls with polite interest,
patting their noses, laying a finger here and
there, shooting quick glances at their legs.
Not a glance or movement of this escaped
Jard, who watched him with a twinkle in one
eye and a probe in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very useful,” was the stranger’s comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard nodded and crossed the floor and
opened the upper wing of the door of one of
the boxes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look a-heer at something different,” he
said. “Lady Firefly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane joined him and looked into the roomy,
well lighted box. A roan filly turned and
thrust a silken muzzle into Jard’s face, then
into his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some speed, there, I wouldn’t wonder,”
continued Hassock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” replied Vane. “How
old is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixteen months. She’s a granddaughter
of the Willy Horse’s sister—or maybe it was
his half-sister. You can’t get much information
out of old Luke Dangler. You said
you’d heard tell of the Willy Horse, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this here’s the same strain. There
was an English mare come to this country a
hundred years ago. Her name was Willoughby
Girl. Ever hear of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have heard of Willoughby Girl,”
said Vane quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard Hassock leaned nearer to the stranger,
shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s her blood in this here filly,” he
whispered. “I’ll tell you about it. It’s a
queer story, an’ a bit of history—— Hark!”
he said. “Was that Liza hollerin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Liza, beyond a doubt; and Jard left
the stable to see what she wanted of him. He
was back in half a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Joe Hinch come over from McPhee’s
to thank you for the good work you done last
night,” he informed Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was nothing,” said Vane. “I just happened
to be Johnny-on-the-spot, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You best come along in with me, anyhow,”
returned Jard. “It’ll be best for you an’ best
for me, mister—for Liza told me to fetch
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane went. In the big kitchen they found
Miss Hassock and a young woman. Vane
doffed his cap and glanced around, but failed
to see anything of the lad he had dragged out
of bed. His glance returned inquiringly to
the faces of Liza and the young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe, this is the gent who saved your precious
life last night,” said Jard. “Meet Mr.
Vane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger was a man of breeding, and a
man of the world to boot—but Jard’s words
threw him off his mental balance into a spiritual
and mental fog, and left him there. Again
he sent a searching glance into the corners of
the room and even behind the stove in quest
of Joe. He didn’t move anything but his eyes.
He didn’t say a word. His baffled glance returned
to the young woman. Again his eyes
met hers, again she smiled faintly, and now
she blushed. She was moving toward him;
and this she continued to do until she was
within two feet of him. She extended a hand,
which he took and held, acting by instinct
rather than by reason. She lowered her
glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you—very, very much,” she said
somewhat breathlessly. “It was very—kind
of you—and brave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—don’t mention it, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s Joe,” said Miss Hassock, suddenly
enlightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one you drug out of bed,” said Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josephine,” whispered the young woman,
bowing her head yet lower and gently attempting
to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane saw it. It dawned on him. The blood
crawled up beyond his neck again and fed his
brain, and the fog melted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!—of course,” he said. “It was you.
I am glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed and gently released her hand.
She murmured a few more words of gratitude,
then slipped away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why wouldn’t she stop to dinner?” asked
Jard of his sister. “I asked her to often
enough and hearty enough; an’ even if I hadn’t,
I guess she knows she’s always welcome
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s only twenty-three, that’s why,” returned
Miss Hassock. “If she was my age
she’d of stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-three? Well, reckon she is—but
what’s her age got to do with stoppin’ here
to dinner?” demanded Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All her own clothes got burnt up,” replied
Liza. “They weren’t many nor much, but
they fitted her to a wish, for she made every
stitch herself, outside an’ inside. What she
has on this mornin’ belongs to Susan McPhee,
who’s near as tall as me an’ bigger round
everywheres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I get you,” said Jard. “That’s the woman
of her! A queen in one skirt an’ a scart rabbit
in another! But she looked all right to
me. Didn’t she look all right, Mr. Vane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very charming, I thought,” replied Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better’n you expected, hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I had no idea, no suspicion, of the
truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you cal’late this Joe was, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stable-boy, or something of that sort.
A quite natural mistake, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It don’t sound to me like a mistake a
gentleman would make. The prettiest girl on
this river—the prettiest girl I ever see—that’s
Joe Hinch; an’ you grab her out of bed an’
pass her through the window an’ think she’s
a stable-boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of it? I couldn’t see!” retorted
Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard wagged his head.</p>

<h3>THROW-BACKS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s throw-backs in folks jist like
in horses,” said the proprietor of Moosehead
House, seating himself close to the
kitchen stove and waving his guest to a rocking
chair. “An’ that girl, Joe Hinch, is a
throw-back—an’ a long throw—clear beyond
my memory, anyhow. She’s got more than
looks—more of some other things than she has
of looks—an’ you know what she looks like!
That’s sayin’ somethin’ would crack a stiff
jaw, hey? Well, it’s the truth! She’s got
brains, an’ she’s got speerit—and she’s got
honesty! The Lord only knows where she
got that. That’s where the long throw comes
in. She’s an orphant. But she’s got the worst
two old grandpas you could find if you
hunted a week. I’ll bet a dollar there ain’t
a worse pair of grandpas in the whole province,
or maybe not in the whole country, when
it comes to sheer downright cussedness an’
crookedness. Ain’t that right, Liza?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so,” replied Miss Hassock, but
Vane saw and felt that she had given no consideration
to her brother’s question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it’s right!” continued Jard, with relish.
“Old Dave Hinch an’ old Luke Dangler!
There’s a pair of hellyuns you wouldn’t
have the heart to wish onto your worst enemy
for grandpas. Dave’s mean an’ crooked an’
a coward. Luke’s mean an’ crooked an
crazy—but he ain’t afeared of anything nor
anybody. Now with horses an’ horned cattle
the top-crosses is the things to look at an’
consider in their pedigrees; an’ so it should
be with humans, and usually is—but there’s
throw-backs in both, now an’ then. There
must surely be some fine strains in Joe’s pedigree,
but an all-fired long ways back. The
Danglers have speerit an’ looks, right enough,
but I’m referrin’ to honesty. Why, the biggest
bit of thievery ever done in this province—the
slickest an’ coolest an’ sassiest ever
pulled off without benefit of lawyers—was
done by her great-grandpa, old Luke’s own
pa, one hundred years ago. That fetches me
right around to what I was tellin’ you in the
stable about how this strain of blood got into
this country. Now that’s queer—talkin’ of
throw-backs—for the Willy Horse was one
jist as certain as Joe Hinch is one. He
throwed clear back to that English mare, he
did. He was the dead spit, the livin’ image,
of the English mare Luke Dangler’s pa stole
an’ hid in the year eighteen hundred an’
twenty-three. His name was Mark—Mark
Dangler—but they tell how the Injuns named
him Devil-kill-a-man-quick, an’ he was most
generally called Devil Dangler for short by
whites an’ Injuns. That was Luke’s own pa.
He was a handy man with a knife. He could
throw a knife that quick that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jard!” exclaimed Miss Hassock. “If that
old Dangler ever threw knives half as fast
as you wag your tongue he’d of killed off all
the settlers on the river in half a day. That
story will keep, Jard—though I don’t say
this gentleman won’t be interested in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, I’m interested in it,” replied
Vane. “In fact, what I really came here
for”—and here Jard looked up expectantly—“was
in the hope of finding a good young
horse of the Eclipse strain of blood. Willoughby
Girl, that stolen mare—whose story
I’ve known for a very long time—was a grandfather
of the great Eclipse. She was a bay
with white legs. Eclipse was also a bay with
white legs. But her dam, Getaway, was a
strawberry roan. So the color of your filly
looks good—but bay is the true Eclipse color.
The mare, Willoughby Girl, was ten years
old when she was brought to this country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An Englishman named Willoughby was
her owner. When he came out to this province
with the intention of buying land and
settling here, he brought Willoughby Girl
with him, for she was the greatest mare in
the world, in his opinion. The loss of her
sickened him of the country. He spent thousands
of pounds in searching for her. It was
his belief that she had been run across the
border, so it was in the states that he did all
his searching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard was staring in open-eyed amazement
at all this knowledge—so much clearer
even than his own—but Vane seemed to take
it as a matter of course and went right
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always been interested in this story
of Willoughby Girl, and then I came across
the records of Strawberry Lightning and the
Willy Horse. Later on I saw both of them
at different tracks—you see I am keen on
horses, anyway—and heard a vague story
about a stolen English mare that was their
ancestor. As you say, the Willy Horse was
a direct throw-back. I discovered they both
came originally from this neck of the woods,
and I came to investigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I planned to keep it quiet about what I
wanted, because I am not a rich man, but I
am determined to own a horse of that strain.
I know I needn’t worry about you and Miss
Hassock, for I see that you are both sportsmen.
But I must ask you to keep my mission
to this part of the country under your hats.
I want a horse, but I can’t pay any fancy price
for one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane even fetched a leather portfolio from
his room and showed Willoughby Girl’s pedigree
to his host and hostess, whose interest
was only too manifest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard Hassock gloated over it, breathing
heavily through his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could see Luke Dangler’s records—if
Luke was halfway human—I could hitch
my own little filly onto this here pedigree,”
he whispered at last. “Onto this here royal
pedigree! Can you beat it!”</p>

<h3>THE DANGEROUS DANGLERS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Jard Hassock and Robert Vane talked
horses. Jard now did most of the talking.
The glorious pedigree of Willoughby Girl
had affected him as the bray of trumpets affects
old cavalry horses, as the piping of a high
wind in tree tops reawakens life and longing
in the arteries of retired mariners dozing in
cottage gardens. His memory flashed pictures
appealing and glamorous to his mind’s
eye, of cheering crowds and white-fenced
tracks and satin-coated horses speeding with
outstretched necks. His experiences had
been entirely with harness racing—but the
horses who trot and pace are of the same
strains of blood as those who run. He remembered
only the tingle and rush of victory.
The dust of defeat was forgotten. He lamented
Lady Firefly’s extreme youth; and
for a moment he considered the advisability
of approaching old Luke Dangler in his
stronghold on Goose Creek. But only for a
moment. He knew Luke. Luke had some
promising youngsters in his stable—all presumably
of the old blood—but he knew by
experience all the drawbacks to doing business
with that violent and cunning old crook.
He knew that Luke had something better
than the little filly Lady Firefly. The fact
that Luke had parted with the roan filly, even
on the amazing terms which he had forced
upon Jard, was proof enough for Jard that
he held something better of the old blood in
reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard was not proud of the terms on which
he had gained possession of the roan filly. He
was heartily ashamed of them; and he had
kept them strictly to himself until, in the excitement
produced by the perusal of Willoughby
Girl’s pedigree, he showed his copy
of the agreement to Robert Vane. He had
paid four hundred dollars for Lady Firefly
as a foal, and had pledged his word (written
and witnessed) that he would not part with
her without Luke Dangler’s permission, that
Luke was to have one-half of the price if a
sale were made, and that if she were bred
from while in Jard’s possession Luke was to
have a half-interest in all offspring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you agreed to this?” queried Vane, in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my only way of gettin’ her; an’ I
got to have a bit of speed comin’ along in my
stable—simply got to! It’s the way I was
made. Life ain’t worth gettin’ out of bed
for without it. I’ve tried. An’ I’ve tried
other strains of blood, but I never won a race
with anything but what I got from Luke
Dangler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what about the others, the Willy
Horse and Strawberry Lightning? Did you
own them on the same conditions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I owned the Willy Horse hoof an’
hide, an’ I bred the mare myself. But I had
to sell the horse to Luke Dangler for four
hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had to is right, mister. Them Danglers
an’ old Dave Hinch work together. Dave’s
a money-lender—one of the real old-fashioned
kind—and a note-shaver. He got hold of
some of my paper once. ’Nough said! An’
the Danglers! Say, mister, any man who gets
in dead wrong with a Dangler of Goose Crick
had best clear out of this section of woods, or
he’ll find himself dead in it some day. Yes,
mister, they squoze the Willy Horse out of
me an’ sold him down in Maryland for three
thousand; an’ he was sold in New Orleans a
year after that for twenty thousand; an’ when
Luke an’ Dave seen that on the sportin’ pages
they was mad enough to bite horseshoes. An’
it was for fear of them two old crooks I sold
Strawberry Lightnin’. As soon as she won
a few races they got after me; an’ they’d of
got her, too—or me—if I hadn’t sold her
quick acrost the line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s this Goose Creek?” asked Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you want to know for?” countered
Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going there to-morrow to have a look
at this old ruffian Dangler and his horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a few days to think it over,” advised
Jard. “If you walk right up to old
Luke’s house an’ say you want to look over
his horses with the intention of buyin’ one,
he’ll size you up for a millionaire an’ act
accordin’. So far, except for the few deals
he’s made with me, he’s done all his business
down in the States. The farther away from
home he sells a horse of the old blood the
better he’s pleased. Maybe he’s still scart of
the law gettin’ him somehow for what his pa
did ninety-nine years ago, or maybe it’s nothin’
but the plain hoggishness of his nature,
but he keeps mighty quiet an’ secret about his
business in this province. He loses money by
it, for you can bet he don’t get what he asks
down there among them lads, with three or
four days of railroadin’ behind him, but ends
in takin’ what he can get. Away from his
own stampin’ ground, an’ among men maybe
as crooked as himself, but with more brains
an’ better manners, I guess he gets the light
end of the deal every time. So I reckon he’s
scart. If he wasn’t he’d show a certified pedigree
for the horses he sells, with Willoughby
Girl played up big in it—but nothin’ of the
kind! If you was to mention that stolen mare
to him he’d pertend he didn’t know what you
was talkin’ about—but you’d want to get a
long ways off from Goose Crick before dark
jist the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what would happen if I saw his horses
and made him an offer for one of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you’d get the horse—if you
offered twenty thousand for it, or maybe if
you offered ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No chance! But what if I made a reasonable
offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d be sore as a boil; an’ he’d cal-late
you’d come all the way from New York jist
to spy on him—an’ you’d be lucky if you got
out alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s absurd! Isn’t there any law in
this country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty of it. Game laws an’ all sorts.
There’s the law old Dave Hinch uses when
he gets hold of a bit of paper with your name
on it, even if you never saw the danged thing
before, or have maybe paid it twice already.
But there ain’t no law ag’in a man losin’ himself
in the woods. That’s the Dangler way,
but don’t tell them I said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really know something, or are you
only talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what I’m talkin’ about, an’ I’m
talkin’ for your good, Mr. Vane. I got a
pretty clear memory more’n forty years long;
an’ I can remember quite a slew of folks
who’ve fell out with the Danglers one way an’
another; an’ some of them cleared out, an’
four was lost in the woods—five, countin’ poor
Pete Sledge. Pete’s the only man I know of
who ever defied the Danglers and refused to
run away, an’ is still alive right here in Forkville.
But you’d ought to see Pete. He’d be
a lesson to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard tapped his brow significantly with a
finger-tip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost an’ found ag’in,” he said. “But he
was half-witted when they found him, an’
he’s been that way ever since—an’ that was
nigh onto twenty years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He tells a queer story—but you can’t pin
it on any Dangler, even if you believe it.
Pete an’ one of the Dangler men fell out about
a girl. Pete wiped up Gus Johnson’s chipyard
with that Dangler. There was good
trappin’ country way up Squaw Brook in
them days, an’ Pete used to work it. He had
a little shack up there, an’ that’s where he’d
spend most of the winter, tendin’ his traps.
It was along in the fall of the year he knocked
Dangler down an’ drug him around; an’ it
was along in the first week of January he
woke up in his bunk on Squaw Brook one
night jist in the nick of time to bust his
way out an’ take a roll in the snow. He
had most of his clothes on, for he’d been
sleepin’ in them; an’ he had his top blanket,
an’ his mackinaw with mitts in the pockets,
which he had grabbed up an’ brought out with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roof fell in before he could figure on
how to save anything else but his snowshoes,
which stood jist inside the door. His rifle an’
pelts an’ grub were all burned—all except a
ham, which was roasted to a turn when he
raked it out with a long pole. His axe was in
the choppin’-block. He cut the blanket an’
tied up his feet in strips of it, wonderin’ all
the time how the shack come to catch fire.
So he took a look around, by the light of a
half-moon, an’ he found tracks leadin’ right
up to the smokin’ mess that had been his shack
an’ right away ag’in. But they were bear
tracks. So he cal’lated it must of been the
stovepipe, for how could a bear set a fire?
Where would he get the matches? But he
took another think; an’ then he put on his
snowshoes an’ shouldered the ham an’ the axe
an’ lit out after the bear. It was a big bear,
to judge by its paws; an’ he was mad enough
to kill it with the axe. He reckoned that
would serve it right for not bein’ asleep in a
hole like a decent bear should of been, even
if it hadn’t set fire to his camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the best part of a mile he followed
along jist as fast as he could lift his webs an’
spat ’em down ag’in, until he had to stop an’
tie up one of his blanket socks; an’ that give
him a close-up view of the tracks which he
hadn’t taken since his first examination of
them, an’ he seen that the old varmint wasn’t
usin’ his forepaws now but was travelin’ on
his hind legs only. Well, sir, that made him
madder yet an’ kinder pleased with the way
things were shapin’, too; so he tore off enough
of the roasted ham to fill his pockets an’
throwed away the rest of it an’ lit out on the
tracks of that queer bear ag’in like he was
runnin’ a race with the champeen snowshoer
of Montreal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dawn came up red, an’ still the bear
wasn’t in sight. Pete kept right on, but not
quite so fast, chawin’ ham as he traveled. He
cal-lated he was makin’ better time than any
bear could run on its hind legs, an’ would
overhaul it in another hour at the outside.
Pretty soon he picked up a burnt match.
Then he <span class='it'>knew</span> he wouldn’t have much trouble
skinnin’ that bear when once he’d caught it.
But he wished harder’n ever he had his rifle—for
a bear that carries matches is jist as like
as not to tote a gun, too. The ham an’ the
runnin’ give him a plagued thrist, an’ he went
an’ et some snow instead of waitin’ till he come
to a brook an’ choppin’ a waterhole. He et
some more snow, an’ that kinder took the heart
out of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was jist on the p’int of quittin’ an’
turnin’ off to shape a bee-line for the nearest
clearance, when his nose caught a whiff of
cold tobacco smoke on the air. That told him
Mister Bear wasn’t far ahead, an’ he broke
into runnin’ ag’in jist as tight as he could flop
his webs. But he didn’t get far that time.
What with thirst an’ bellyache an’ the bum
riggin’ he had on his feet instead of moccasins,
he tripped an’ took a hell of a tumble.
An’ when he got himself right-end-up an’
sorted out he found a pain in his right ankle
like a knife an’ one of his snowshoes busted
an’ the sun all grayed over. He was in a
nasty fix. He tried travelin’ on one foot, but
that soon bested him. His ankle was real
bad. Atop all that, he was in a bit of country
he didn’t recognize an’ couldn’t get a glimpse
of the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got together some dry stuff for a fire—an’
then he remembered how careful he’d
been to take his matchbox out of his pocket
an’ put it on the table the night before—so’s
he’d be sure to fill it chock-a-block in the
mornin’. But he found one loose match. He
fumbled that the first try, an’ at the second
try the head come off it. Can you beat it?
Well, sir, he kinder lost his grip then an’
spent quite a while feelin’ through his pockets
over an’ over ag’in for another match. Then
he tried hoppin’ ag’in. Then he tried crawlin’—but
the snow was too deep for that game.
He let some more snow melt in his mouth,
but his throat was so sore already it was all he
could do to swaller it. All of a sudden he
heard a kinder devilish laugh, an’ that started
him rarin’ round ag’in on one foot, though he
didn’t see nothin’, till he fell down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After that he dug a hole in the snow an’
cut some fir boughs an’ snugged down. He
heard that laugh plenty of times ag’in, an’ for
the first few times he crawled out after it; but
pretty soon it scart him so he couldn’t move.
He says he don’t remember what he did after
that, but when Noel an’ Gabe Sabattis found
him next day he had ten big spruces felled an’
was whirlin’ into the eleventh an’ tellin’ the
world he had the devil treed at last. Crazy
as a coot! He ain’t recovered yet, though
he’s quiet enough an’ talks sane now an’ then.
He knows who set his shack a-fire, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Vane. “And do
you believe it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe he had the devil up a tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That someone set fire to his camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I do, an’ that Amos Dangler’s the
man who done it, with the paws of a bear on
his feet an’ hands. But don’t tell anybody I
said so, for the love of Mike!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a brief but thoughtful silence Vane
said, “If I should happen to get in wrong
with that bunch, I promise you I won’t run
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you want a horse real bad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do now—but it was more a sentimental
whim than anything else that brought me
here. Your Danglers don’t scare me worth
a cent, Jard. They make me hot behind
the ears. Now I’ll have the best animal
they’ve got of the old strain, if it takes me a
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe my filly’s as good as anything Luke
Dangler’s got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that proves to be the case I’ll take her,
too, if you’ll sell. But I tell you frankly that
it’s a Dangler horse I want now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard wagged his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tom McPhee came in that evening with a
face of concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe’s gone,” he said. “Steve Dangler
come for her, an’ took her out to her grandpa’s.
Goose Crick’s no place for a girl like
Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell did you let her go for?”
cried Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you of let her go?” returned
McPhee pointedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard sighed, and scratched his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wouldn’t of!” exclaimed Miss
Hassock. “I wouldn’t of let all the Danglers
on the crick budge her an inch out of my
house—and you men can put that in your
pipes and see how it smokes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hassock and McPhee exchanged expressive
glances and uneasy smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did old Dave go, too?” asked Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not,” replied McPhee. “He’s
comin’ here to-morrow. He says he’ll take
Joe back to keep house for him when he rebuilds
next summer, but he won’t pay her
board to live in idleness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what you pulled out of the fire,”
said Jard, turning accusingly to Vane. Then,
“What’s he comin’ here for?” he asked McPhee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To live till he rebuilds, that’s all. He says
Molly’s biscuits ain’t fit to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will find mine worse,” said Miss Hassock
grimly. “But that ain’t the point. It’s
Joe I’m worryin’ about. Them Danglers is
all rough an’ tough, men an’ women alike.
It was a bad day for Joe old Dave Hinch’s
house burnt down. If I was a man I’d bust
up that bunch on Goose Crick if I was killed
for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been there nigh onto a hundred years;
an’ I reckon there’s as good men hereabouts
as anywhere,” objected McPhee. “If the
law can’t fasten nothin’ onto them, what can
us fellers do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law!” exclaimed Liza derisively.
“An’ what about the officers of the law? The
law’s no more than printed words if it ain’t
worked by human hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane gave Jard Hassock the slip next
morning and went for a walk. He halted at
the top of the hill above the upper end of the
village and lit his pipe and looked around.
He saw black woods and white clearings up
hill and down dale, a few scattered farmhouses
with azure smoke ascending to a blue
sky washed with sunshine, the roofs of the
village crawling down to the low black ruins
that had been old Dave Hinch’s house, and to
the covered bridge across the white stream, and
the twisting road and climbing hills beyond
the bridge. He saw the fork in the river, above
the bridge, after which the village had been
named. He thought of the queer chance that
had brought him to this place just in time to
save the great-granddaughter of Mark Dangler
from death by fire. He saw a man issue
from the back door of the nearest house, run
to the road and ascend the hill toward him at
a brisk jog. He waited, under the impression
that he was the man’s objective. He was
right. The countryman came up to him, grinning
apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you spare me a few matches, stranger?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane was surprised at the question, but instantly
produced a dozen or more loose
matches and handed them over. They were
gratefully received and carefully tucked
away in an inner pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always carry a-plenty now, an’ pick up
more ever’ chance I get, for once I was caught
with only one,” explained the villager. “An’
that one was bad.” He smiled knowingly.
“I reckon it ain’t likely I’ll ever be caught
with only one match ag’in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane saw something unusual about the fellow’s
eyes. They were bright, they were
gentle, though intent in their glance, and yet
in their expression something expected was
lacking, and something unlooked for was present.
The effect was disconcerting. Otherwise
the man looked normal enough. His full
beard and heavy mustache were dark brown
streaked with gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you point me the way to Goose
Creek?” asked Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other faced the north, and pointed with
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It lays five mile upstream, but there ain’t
no settlement at the mouth,” he said.
“They’re all Danglers on that crick, but some
of ’em has other names. It’s about seven mile
by road straight through to their main settlement
from here. But if ye’re lookin’ for
Amos Dangler ye’re too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the road?” asked Vane, pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, but if ye’re lookin’ for Amos
you won’t find him. He come snoopin’
’round my girl—Kate Johnson’s her name—an’
I chased him into the top of a big spruce
an’ chopped him down an’ fixed him for
keeps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long ago did that happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a spell back. Maybe a month—maybe
a year. It was winter time, anyhow—an’
Kate an’ me figger to get married in the
spring. Do you happen to have a few matches
on you more’n you need?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again a few matches changed pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always make a p’int of pickin’ ’em up,”
explained the collector. “Good things for to
keep handy, matches. When you do need ’em,
you need ’em bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you,” returned Vane. “A match
is like a gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somethin’ like, but not altogether. You
can’t light a fire with an axe—but sometimes
you can make an axe do instead of a gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s so. You are Pete Sledge,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me. How did you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s hesitation, Vane replied,
“Jard Hassock spoke of you as the smartest
hunter and trapper in these parts. I put two
and two together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other nodded, evidently quite satisfied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you know all this country for
miles around as well as you know this village,”
added Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Sledge nodded. “Like that,” he
said, extending his left hand and opening it
palm upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m interested in the country,” said Vane.
“I wish you would take me out sometimes.
I can travel on snowshoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any night you say, stranger. But no
shootin’, mind you! It’s close season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to shoot anything. But why
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night? I don’t run the woods in the daytime
now, nor ain’t for quite a spell—for a
year, maybe—or maybe two. There’s a reason,
but I can’t jist agsactly recollect it. Maybe
it’s because I stop to home an’ sleep all
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! I’ll meet you here at eleven o’clock
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you best give me a call. That there’s
my window. You give a knock on it with yer
knuckles, an’ I’ll be right there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They retraced their steps as far as Pete
Sledge’s little house in company. Then Vane
returned directly to Moosehead House. He
heard from Miss Hassock that old Dave had
not yet put in an appearance.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap05'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h3>THE GUARDED ROAD</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Vane told Jard Hassock of his meeting
with poor Pete Sledge but not a word
about their engagement for eleven o’clock
that night. He spoke of Pete’s illusion to the
effect that he killed Amos Dangler with an
axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, that’s his crazy idee,” said Jard.
“An’ Amos Dangler keeps out of his way.
That ain’t hard to do, for Pete sticks pretty
close ’round home. He’s crazy—but he’s still
got a heap of ordinary horse-sense left, has
Pete Sledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s become of the girl they fought
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate Johnson? She married Amos Dangler
eighteen years ago an’ is still alive an’
hearty up Goose Crick, far’s I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pete thinks she is going to marry him in
the spring. It seems that he has not kept a
very close watch on the flight of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s crazy. Sometimes he talks as if his
shack on Squaw Brook was burned down only
a week ago. An’ he’s everlasting’ly beggin’
matches. Keeps every pocket of every coat
he owns full of matches. But he’s still got
streaks of sanity. He has brains enough, but
some of them’s got twisted, that’s all. Nobody
can best him at a game of checkers nor
at raisin’ chickens an’ gettin’ aigs. It’s a
queer case. Now what do you reckon would
happen if the truth that he didn’t ever kill
Amos Dangler was to pop into his head some
day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering the same thing. What
do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess he’d rectify his mistake without
loss of time—an’ that he’d do it with an axe.
Maybe he’d even chase Amos up a tree first
an’ then chop him down, jist so’s to have everything
right. Folks who’ve been demented,
crazy, lunatic as long as Pete has ain’t always
practical. They like to do things their own
way, but they sure like to do ’em. How do
you cal’late to set about gettin’ a horse out of
old Luke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking of lunatics, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, you got to use the best part of
valor, that’s a sure thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you. One or the other of us
should think of a way in a few days. There’s
no particular hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotel had only two guests at this time,
Vane and the person whom he had heard
snoring on the night of his spectacular arrival.
The snorer was the manager of the
“Grange” store, an elderly, anxious looking
man who always returned to the store immediately
after dinner and retired to his room immediately
after supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The afternoon passed without sight or further
word of old Dave Hinch; but Tom McPhee
appeared after supper with a budget of
intelligence that was well received by the
Hassocks. Old Hinch was ill—so ill that he
had sent Tom down to Rattles for the doctor—so
ill that his conscience was troubling him
for having parted with his granddaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he don’t feel better by mornin’ he’ll
send for her,” said McPhee. “And a good
thing, too. That young skunk Steve Dangler’s
sweet on the girl; an’ Dave knows it. Now
that he’s feelin’ real sick he don’t like it. He
ain’t a bad sort of old man when he’s scart
he may die any minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Luke Dangler won’t sent Joe back
ag’in. He’s as much her grandpa as Dave
Hinch himself,” said Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Dave’s her guardeen, which Luke
ain’t,” returned McPhee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eleven o’clock that night Robert Vane
rattled his fingernails on the glass of Pete
Sledge’s dark window. Nothing happened.
He tapped again, louder this time, and waited
expectantly for the sudden flare of a match
behind the black panes. Nothing flared; and
he was about to rap a yet louder summons on
the window when a slight sound behind him
caused him to jump and turn in his tracks.
There stood Pete Sledge a few paces off, with
an axe on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon I give you a start,” said Pete in a
pleased tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did,” returned Vane. “I was looking
for you in front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stopped inside long’s I could after ma
went to bed, an’ then I come out an’ waited behind
the woodpile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why behind the woodpile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No harm intended, but yer a stranger to
me. But I reckon yer all right. Which way
d’ye want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Goose Creek?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Sledge stepped close to Vane at that
and peered keenly into his face for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend of them Danglers?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never set my eyes on a Dangler in my
life, but I’ve heard of them from Jard Hassock
and I’m curious about them,” replied
Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you go over to Goose Crick
with Jard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t go. He seems to be afraid of
the place—and the people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you ain’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not worth a cent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sledge showed signs of embarrassment. “I
ain’t what you would properly call scart, but
I don’t jist hanker after that there section of
country,” he said. “Oh, no, I ain’t scart!
Ain’t I fell out with them Danglers an’ bested
’em? But Goose Crick don’t interest me none.
But what is it you want of them folks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a curiosity concerning them which
I think is quite natural. I want to see where
they live—the people who have thrown a
scare into the whole countryside. If you
won’t come along, I’ll go alone. They must
be very remarkable people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Sledge said nothing to that, did nothing.
Vane went out to the road and up the
hill. He had expected better of Pete Sledge
in the way of courage—though why, considering
the fact that the poor fellow had already
been frightened half out of his wits, it is difficult
to say. At the top of the rise above
Forkville he turned into the side road which
Pete had indicated to him that morning. It
was a well pounded track which cut through
snowdrifts at some points, and humped itself
over them at others. For a mile or two it
passed through white clearings broken by
groups of farm buildings and scattered groves,
and beyond that it slipped into obscurity between black
walls of second-growth spruce
and fir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane walked alone, to the best of his knowledge
and belief; and he felt lonely. He felt
uneasy. Rifts in the marching ranks of the
forest admitted pale glimmers of starshine to
the road here and there, discovering the depths
of the darkness and queer lumps of shadow
and weird blotches of pallor right and left
to his exploring glances. He wondered just
why he had come, not to mention what he
would do when he arrived. He remembered
that it is recorded somewhere that curiosity
killed the cat. It is doubtful if he would have
felt any better if he had known that Pete
Sledge was behind him, within fifty paces of
him. He didn’t know it, but it was so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there a narrow clearing widened
the outlook slightly without enlivening it.
At the edge of one of these crouched a little
deserted lath mill, its fallen tin smokestack
and sagging roof eloquent of failure, disillusion,
the death of a petty ambition. This
was at least six miles from Forkville, at a
rough guess; and as soon as he was past it
Vane began looking eagerly into the gloom
ahead for a glimpse of the clearings of the
Dangler settlement; but before he had gone
two hundred yards beyond the deserted mill
he heard a piercing whistle behind him. He
jumped to the side of the road and crouched
there, every sense alert and straining. There
had been no possibility of mistaking the significant
character of the shrill sound. It had
been a warning and a signal. And within ten
seconds it was answered, repeated, at a point
in the darkness two hundred yards or so
farther along in the direction of the Goose
Creek settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane realized that, with an alert sentry
behind him and another in front of him, now
was the time for quick action. He didn’t
even pause to wonder what the sinister Danglers
could be about to make the posting of
sentries on the road worth their while. Noiselessly
and swiftly he shifted his snowshoes
from his shoulders to his feet; and then, after
a moment given to sensing his position in relation
to the river and Forkville, and the lay
of the land, he slipped noiselessly into the
thick and elastic underbrush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second sentry, the man who had repeated
the shrill warning of Vane’s approach
was Hen Dangler, one of the middle-aged
members of the gang, a nephew of old Luke.
Having passed along the signal and heard it
answered from the nearest house, he grasped
a sled-stake of rock maple firmly in his right
hand and closed swiftly upon the point on
the road from which the first whistle had
sounded. This was according to plan. He
ran silently, listening for sounds of a struggle
or of flight and pursuit. He heard nothing;
and he encountered nothing until he found
the first sentry, the original alarmist, flat on
his face in the middle of the road and blissfully
unconscious of his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unconscious sentry was Steve Dangler,
Hen’s son, the very same Steve who was “sweet
on” his second cousin, Joe Hinch. After a
face massage with snow and a gulp from
Hen’s flask, he opened his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?” asked Hen. “Why the
hell didn’t you leave him pass you an’ git
between us, like we planned? You must of
blowed yer whistle right in his face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Face, nothin’. He passed me, all right.
Then I whistled—an’ got yer answer—an’
started after him—an’ then—good night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell! Say, there must be two of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t wonder, onless I kicked up
behind an’ beaned meself with me own
foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was it—the one you seen go past
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. Stranger to me. Rigged out like
a sport, far’s I could see—blast ’im! Last
time he’ll ever git past this baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so. If you feel up to steppin’ out
we’d best be headin’ along for home. Take a
holt on my arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made what speed they could toward
the clearings and habitations of Goose Creek,
probing the shadows about them with apprehensive
eyes, and questioning the silence with
anxious ears. Clear of the wood at last, they
drew deep breaths of relief. They felt better,
but only for a brace of seconds. Fear of
immediate physical attack was gone, only to
be replaced by anxiety for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t it beat damnation!” lamented the
father. “Here we been layin’ out ’most every
night for two months an’ nothin’ happened an’
then the very first time there’s any need for it
you go an’ git fooled an’ beaned into the bargain!
Say, I wisht I’d been where you was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zat so? Keep in mind that ye’re talkin’ to
yer pa, Steve Dangler. It wouldn’t of happened
like that if I’d been there. My wits
wouldn’t of been wool-pickin’ after no danged
girl. I’d been watchin’ out behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, pa. You tell old Luke all about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long journey on a curved course,
and much thrusting through tough underbrush
and climbing up and plunging down,
Robert Vane came out on the highroad at the
top of the hill above the village. He halted
there to remove his webs, and was there confronted
by poor Pete Sledge who appeared
out of the vague starshine as if by magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’you like them Danglers?” asked
Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t met any of them yet,” replied
Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor you don’t want to. Leave ’em lay,
stranger, leave ’em lay. Run home quick an’
go to bed, an’ don’t tell a word of what happened
to-night to Jard Hassock nor nobody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by what happened to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you got a scare, didn’t you? You
didn’t come home the same way you went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you took to the woods. You was scart
enough for that—an’ smart enough. Leave
’em lay, stranger; an’ if I was you I’d get out
of this here Forkville to-morrow an’ try
somewheres else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try what somewhere else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete winked and asked for a match. He
tucked the match away in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it you want of Goose Crick?” he
asked. “Whatever you want, it’s nothin’ only
trouble you’ll get—but jist tell me, an’ I’ll
tell if you’re lyin’ or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very good of you. I’ll think it
over. Now I’m off for bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold yer hosses a minute! You can trust
me. I love a Dangler like a lad goin’ a-courtin’
loves to meet a skunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you say, but I’m not so sure of it as I
was a while ago. To be quite frank with
you, there was someone behind me to-night—and
whoever he was, he was in league with
the Danglers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was two behind you to-night. Two.
An’ I was only one of ’em. T’other was
young Steve Dangler. But Steve didn’t know
I was there, which was a pity for him, but a
good thing for me an’ you. I didn’t reckon
you’d have sense enough to take to the woods,
so I up an’ beaned Steve so’s to clear the road
behind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a fact?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sure is. But come along away from
here. Come with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete led Vane to his own little barn behind
his little house and up a ladder into a little
hay loft. From this loft, through a crack
between two weather-warped boards, one
could watch the road from the top of the hill
all the way down through the village to the
covered bridge. Vane kept in close touch
with his guide, ready for anything. They sat
down on fragrant hay; and Pete kept his eye
on the crack and Vane kept an eye on Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was you expectin’ to find on Goose
Crick?” asked Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse,” replied Vane, after a moment’s
pause. “You are welcome to the information—and
so is old Luke Dangler. Now what
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I said—and it’s exactly what
I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse? Is that all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all—but it seems to be plenty—more
than enough—to judge from the way
Jard Hassock talks. Well, what about
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to steal a horse? You figgered
out to steal a horse from old Luke Dangler
to-night? Say, stranger, that sounds jist about
crazy enough to be true! Jumpin’ cats!
Stranger, Jard Hassock’s right. It can’t be
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to buy a horse, if he has one that
suits me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy a horse. Say, that’s different. That’s
easy. All you need’s a million dollars—or
maybe ten thousand—or maybe only five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear! I’ll offer a fair price and not
a dollar more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you won’t get no horse—not of the
trottin’ stock, anyhow—but trouble a-plenty.
A horse? You must want one real bad. Now
if it was a woman it would be different, but
any man who’d go git himself mixed up with
them Danglers for a horse—for the best
durned horse in the world—ain’t got all his
brains workin’, to my way of thinkin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be right. They seem to be difficult
people to deal with, that’s a fact. I had
no idea that they went so far as to post sentries
on the road. Have many attempts been made
to steal their horses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete turned his glance from the crack in
the wall to Vane’s face. Vane could see the
glimmer of the eyes and feel the searching of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look like a liar,” said Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you again,” said Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor like a fool,” went on the native in a
puzzled tone. “But you must be one or
t’other—or both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t know why you should think
so,” protested Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ask Jard Hassock. Maybe he will
tell you. I would, only I’m kinder side-steppin’
trouble with them Danglers these days.
A man figgerin’ on fixin’ up with a wife come
spring can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane returned to Moosehead House, entered
the kitchen window and gained his room
and his bed without detection. In spite of the
hour, sleep did not come to him immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was excited and puzzled. The fact of
the sentries on the road in to Goose Creek
puzzled and excited him, and so did the talk
and behavior of Pete Sledge. Why the sentries?
Why the signals? Surely a man could
breed a few horses without such precautions
as these. And what would have happened to
him if the Danglers had caught him? And
what was Pete Sledge’s game—if any? The
fellow talked about marriage to a woman
who was already married, and about having
killed a man who was still alive and hearty
within a few miles of him, and made a point
of begging matches and tucking them away
like precious things—but was he as crazy as
these things suggested? He doubted it.</p>

<h3>THE WARNING</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Vane slept until Jard Hassock awoke him
by pulling his toes. It was then close
upon nine o’clock of a fine morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, what ails you?” asked Jard. “You
act like you’d been up an’ roustin’ round all
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your fine fresh air,” replied Vane,
sliding reluctantly out of bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He breakfasted in the kitchen, but not a
word did he say of the night’s activities. He
was told that McPhee had already called to
say that young Steve Dangler had already
been in from Goose Creek with a message
from old Luke Dangler to old Dave Hinch.
The gist of the message was that Granddaughter
Joe should remain where she was
for as long as Grandpa Dangler chose to keep
her and if Grandpa Hinch didn’t like it the
only thing left for him to do was to lump it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t eight o’clock, but Steve was
slewed already,” concluded Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a cruel, cryin’ shame and disgrace!”
exclaimed Miss Hassock. “Dave Hinch is a
crooked old sinner and mean company for a
girl like Joe—but those Danglers are downright
low. They’ll marry her to that swillin’,
bullyin’ rapscallion Steve, you see if they
don’t; and not a man hereabouts man enough
to raise a hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s his tipple?” asked Vane. “I
thought this country was dry. Surely he is
not drinking lemon extract—and alive to show
it? You used the word swilling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a hog, that’s why—whatever the
stuff in his trough may be,” retorted Liza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard winked at Vane. “You don’t have to
drink lemon extract round here nowadays,
nor ain’t for nigh onto two years,” he said.
“There’s real liquor—so I hear—to be had
for eight dollars a bottle, an’ somethin’ that
acts a darn sight more real for half the price.
All you need’s the money an’ the high sign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Law!” exclaimed Miss Hassock in a voice
of angry derision. “Law! With Danglers
to bust it an’ a bunch of cowards an’ live-an’-let-livers
to look on, what’s the good of a
law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard nodded at Vane. “If Liza had been
born a man she’d of been dead quite a spell
now,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I guess there’d been a few other funerals
about the same time as mine,” said Miss
Hassock, smiling grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bootleggers?—moonshiners?” queried
Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, he felt, explained the sentinels and
the signals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it that time, Mr. Vane—and it’s
a treat to hear a man with grit enough in his
crop to say it out loud, even if he is only
askin’,” returned Liza. “Bootleggers and
moonshiners is right. The Danglers take the
lead in every low devilment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liza’s maybe right an’ maybe wrong,”
said Jard. “I ain’t sayin’ anythin’ about it,
whatever I’m thinkin’; an’ I hope you won’t,
neither—not while you live in Moosehead
House, anyhow. Liza’s mighty free with her
mean names, talkin’ about cowards an’ the
like—but—well, her an’ my property is all
right here—this hotel an’ the land an’ the
barns. So we got to stop right here, an’ I’d
sooner stop here alive than dead. I can’t
afford to be so gosh darned brave—like Liza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire went out of the big woman’s eyes
and the derision left her lips. She strode over
to her brother, stooped and laid a hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please forgive me, Jard,” she said. “You
are right and I am all wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steve Dangler had not come to Forkville
that morning for the sole purpose of delivering
old Luke’s defiant message to old Dave.
He had been instructed to hunt out and look
over and size up the stranger who was rigged
out like a sport, and who had passed him and
yet escaped him the night before. There was
no doubt in either Steve’s or old Luke’s mind
that this person was a police officer or law
officer spying around on behalf of the nearest
Prohibition Enforcement Inspector. But
even so, it would be wise to make sure, and
to size him up and get a line on his character
and methods, before deciding on the safest
and surest way of dealing with him. To date,
the usual methods of lulling official suspicion,
combined with the long-established terror
of the Dangler name, had suffered to keep
inviolate the secret activities of Goose
Creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Steve reached the front door of
Moosehead House, Jard Hassock was gossiping
at the village smithy, Miss Hassock was
in the kitchen and Robert Vane was up in
his room writing a letter to a friend whose
father owned a town house in New York, a
country home on Long Island and a winter
place in Florida. He was writing to the
Florida address. Steve opened the hotel
door, entered, glanced into the empty office on
the right, and the empty “settin’-room” on the
left, cocked his ear for sounds of Miss Hassock,
whom he feared, then ascended the stairs
swiftly and silently. After looking into three
unoccupied bedrooms, he halted and struck a
casual attitude on Vane’s threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Simmons?” he asked. “He ain’t
at the store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a lie, but Steve would rather tell
a lie than the truth even when no advantage
was to be derived from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane looked up from his letter, which was
progressing very slowly and dully, and regarded
the questioner from beneath slightly
raised eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here,” he said, and stared down at the
half-written letter again and crossed out the
last line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lives here, don’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hangs out in this hotel, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He snores here, and eats here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I’ll go try the store ag’in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bad idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane turned his eyes and attention back to
his letter, and Steve shifted his weight uneasily
from foot to foot. Vane made no headway.
He realized that he was not in the least
interested in the task under his pen and suddenly
wondered, with a disconcerting feeling
of futility, if he had ever been sincerely interested
in the person for whom this letter
was intended. Or was it all part of a game—this
unfinished letter and other completed
letters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a seegar, mister,” suggested the
man on the threshold, digging fingers into a
pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll smoke a pipe, if it’s all the same to
you,” returned Vane. “Come in and sit down,
won’t you—if you’re not too busy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other accepted the invitation, selected
a comfortable chair, dropped his cap on the
floor, lit a cigar and spat neatly into the fire.
Vane laid aside his pen, turned an elbow upon
ink and paper and lit his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sportin’?” queried Steve, in his best society
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as you mean,” replied Vane. “I’m
not lookin’ for anything to shoot. Close season,
for that matter. But my visit is certainly
connected with sport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zat so,” returned Steve, with honest curiosity
and ill-hid suspicion conflicting in his
hot brown eyes. “Sport, hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I came here to find a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse? Did you lose one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I have heard of good horses
coming from this part of the country, and I
hope to be able to buy a young one of the good
strain—of the Strawberry Lightning strain.
I’ve seen Hassock’s roan filly, but I hear that
the real breeder is an old man named Luke
Dangler who lives up on Goose Creek. You
know him, I suppose. Do you know if he has
any young bays of that strain? Bay is the
right color—the Willy Horse color. I have
a few hundreds that are ready and eager to
talk horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I know old Luke Dangler. My own
name’s Dangler, an’ I come from Goose Crick
myself. He’s got a couple of young uns of
the right color, an’ the right lines. Say, I
guess ye’re the gent who drug old Dave Hinch
an’ Joe out of the fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I happened along just in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so. But why ain’t you been out to
see Luke Dangler before this? It ain’t far
to his place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of calling on him to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye know the way to Goose Crick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find it, don’t worry. Hassock will
start me right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure he’ll start you right, an’ it’s a straight
road once you git started; an’ you’ll find the
old man all ready to talk horse. I’ll tell him
ye’re comin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steve Dangler went away, puzzled, but still
suspicious. Vane was not exactly what he had
expected to find. The only thing in which the
stranger had met expectations was the matter
of lying. He had lied concerning his knowledge
of the road to Goose Creek, but in everything
else he had proved unexpected. His
manner was not that of any enforcement officer
known to or imagined by Steve. It was
the manner of the best type of “sport” known
to Steve, of the two-guides sportsman. And
the talk about wanting to buy a horse! That
was clever. He’d picked up the dope from
Jard Hassock, of course—but it was smart.
But it didn’t fool Steve. If the stranger had
wanted to see old Luke’s horses, why had he
tried to sneak into the settlement in the middle
of the night—unless he’d figured on stealing
one? No, even Steve could not seriously suspect
him of being a horse-thief. He was some
sort of damn detective looking for something
he knew they wouldn’t show to him, that’s
what he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steve went home and made his report and
as many comments on the subject of the same
as old Luke had patience to listen to. Then
Steve was dismissed, Amos and Hen called in
by the old man, and many methods of eliminating
the dangerous stranger from the existing
scheme of things on Goose Creek were
discussed. Amos was a crafty plotter. He
had a strong imagination of the crafty and
destructive sort, and a genius for detail. No
man had ever escaped from a plot of his planning
except by chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane was at a loss to know what to do next.
His curiosity concerning the Danglers of
Goose Creek was now quite as keen as his distaste
for them, and both his distaste and curiosity
were keener than his original purpose
in visiting Forkville. It was still his intention
to obtain a young animal of the Willoughby
Girl strain, a bay with white legs, for
choice; but to deal these Danglers a blow of
some sort seemed to him now a more worthy
and more intriguing ambition. Something of
the kind was due them. Something of the
nature of a nasty set-back had been due them
for years and years. He decided to have another
session with Pete Sledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was eleven o’clock before Jard left him.
Jard had talked of Eclipse blood for two
hours without a break, but he had not suggested
a way of commencing negotiations with
Luke Dangler for the purchase of a horse.
Vane extinguished the lamp and replenished
the fire upon Jard’s departure. An hour
passed, and he was about to venture forth
and down the stairs and out of the house in
search of Pete when he was startled by a sharp
rap on one of his windows. He jumped to
his feet and faced the window. On the instant
it sounded again, like the impact of a
sliver of ice or fragment of snow-crust on the
thin glass. He jumped to the window and
raised the sash, and was about to stoop and
thrust out his head when something hit him
smartly on the ribs and dropped to the floor.
It was a small white handkerchief weighted
and knotted into a ball. He undid the knots
in a few seconds, and found inside a small
stone and a folded scrap of paper.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Don’t go to Goose Creek to-morrow or ever.
Please go away. You are in great danger.
I warn you in gratitude. Please destroy this
and go away to-morrow morning.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He read it, then stooped again and looked
out and down from the window. In the vague
starshine he could see nothing of the secretive
messenger. He closed the window swiftly
but silently, tossed the scrap of paper into the
fire, pocketed the stone and little handkerchief,
slipped into his outer coat, snatched up
cap and mittens and left the room. He had
been fully dressed, with his moccasins on and
everything ready for a quick exit; and this
fact was the very thing that upset the calculations
of the thrower of the warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane made a clean getaway from the window
of the kitchen, and overtook the running
figure before him just short of the top of the
hill. It was Joe Hinch, carrying her snowshoes
under an arm. She halted and turned at
the touch of his hand, breathing quickly. She
glanced at him, then down, without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I haven’t frightened you,” he said
hurriedly. “But I had to know if it was you—or
a trick. How did you come? How did
you get away? Why are you going back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not a trick,” she replied. “You are
in danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now? Immediate danger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow—and after. If you go, or if
you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who came with you? And why did you
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody. I slipped out easily, and took a
long way through the woods. And now I
must hurry back. And you will promise to
go away to-morrow. Please promise me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why do you go back to that place?
You have a grandfather here, and plenty of
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m as safe there as here. I’m not in any
danger. You are in danger. You must go
away. To-morrow! Promise me that—please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why? What are they afraid of? I
came only to buy a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t believe that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they think I’m after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you. But don’t you believe me?
Don’t you know that I am telling the truth—that
you are in danger? Do you think I’d
came all that way alone through the woods
at night for—for fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you, of course. But I think
you must have an exaggerated idea of the
danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exaggerated! Do you think I’m a fool?
You are in danger of—of—death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death? Then it is not for the first time;
and why should it be the first time for me to
run away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, but it can’t be done. Even if
the danger is as actual as you say—and not
for a moment do I doubt the sincerity of your
belief in it—I can’t allow my plans to be altered
by people of that—by a few suspicious
countrymen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are—my people. Their leader—the
oldest and worst of them—is my grandfather.
I know them better than you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, really I am; and I think you
are a brick for coming out to warn me. You
have more than squared our little account,
for what I did at the fire required very little
effort, and no courage whatever. I promise
not to venture alone into their headquarters
to-morrow, but it is absolutely impossible for
me to run away from them just because they
happen to suspect me of being something I
am not. If I were to do a thing like that, I
shouldn’t be able to live with myself afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear girl, how can I go? My mission
is peaceful and lawful. I’m not looking for
trouble. I am sorry, but you can see how absolutely
impossible it is for me to run away
just to humor a gang of—a violent and suspicious
old man and that ignorant young
lout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he realized that she was weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Hinch! Please—ah, you mustn’t,
really! You are tired—the tramp through
the woods. Come, be a good girl, let me take
you to Miss Hassock, or to the McPhees.
You have friends in this village—plenty of
them, the entire population, I’m sure. Come,
you need a good rest. I’m quite safe, and I’ll
not make trouble. There’s really nothing to
cry about. Come to Miss Hassock, there’s
a good girl. Why should you go back to that
place, anyway—against your guardian’s
wishes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “I—have to—go—for
the safety—of my—friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only through the woods. Only to within
sight of the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The road is guarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know that. I’ll get my snowshoes.
Half a minute. You wait here. I’ll be back
in two ticks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and ran. His rackets were in
the woodshed; and he was soon back with
them. But the young woman was not where
he had left her. He went forward, studying
the edges of the road. He turned into the
Goose Creek road; and then it wasn’t long before
he found where she had jumped off into
a clump of brush. He tightened and tied the
thongs of his snowshoes with eager fingers
and followed eagerly on her tracks.</p>

<h3>THE KNOCKOUT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Vane came up with her within a mile of
the jump-off—and this was closer than he
had hoped for. She neither welcomed nor reproved
him, but only remarked in a noncommittal
voice that he had not been long. He
passed ahead of her, to break trail, and saw
that she was back-tracking on her outward
course. He tramped in silence, glancing frequently
over his shoulder. Presently he found
himself hanging on his stride for her; and
at last she called, “I must rest a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found her a seat among the raking
boughs of a deep-drifted blow-down. Neither
of them spoke during the brief rest; and
in the forest gloom the face of each was no
more than a blurred mask to the other’s eyes.
She soon stood up and moved on, and again
he passed her and led the way. In places the
gloom shut down in absolute dark, with the
vague glimmer of rifts of faint starshine far
behind and far ahead. It was in such a place
that he became suddenly aware that she was
no longer moving close after the dragging
tails of his rackets. He halted and stood for
a few seconds, listening. He moved back
slowly; and soon he came upon her crouched,
sobbing, in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my foot, my ankle,” she said in broken
and contrite tones. “I fell and hurt it—before
you overtook me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knelt before her. This was his fault.
She had fallen and hurt herself in trying to
escape from him. It would have been kinder
of him to have minded his own business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ve walked all this distance on
it!” he exclaimed. “I am a fool! Which is
it? Sprained, do you think, or only a bit of
a twist? May I feel? Let me bandage it or
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The right,” she said. “I don’t think it’s
seriously injured—but it hurts like anything—and
I have to get home before—dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry. But it doesn’t seem to be swollen.
Slightly, perhaps. A strain—I think
that’s all. I’ll tie it tight. I have a simply
huge handkerchief here. Just the thing.
How does that feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better—much better—thank you. I can
go on now—slowly—a little way at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you can’t. The weight of the snowshoe,
the lift of it at every step, would play
the mischief with it. I must take your snowshoes
off and carry you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not! It would kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not heavy. And this is all my
fault. You made this trip to warn me; and
you hurt your ankle running away from me.
All my fault—and I shall be glad to carry
you, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She protested; but he went ahead gently
but firmly, removed her snowshoes from her
feet and hung them on her shoulder and then
crouched and hoisted and jolted her into that
ancient and practical position for carrying
known as pig-a-back. Doubtless it is more
romantic to carry a lady in distress in your
arms, and more dignified to pull her along on
a sled, and even trundling her in a wheelbarrow
(wind and weather permitting) may
seem a more conventional way to some people—but
every woodsman and soldier knows
that pig-a-back is the style when a job of this
sort has to be done for its own sake. Take the
weight, be it dead-weight or live-weight, on
and above the shoulders. Keep under it.
Don’t let it get behind you, dragging your
shoulders down and back and throwing your
feet up and forward. This was old stuff to
Vane—yes, and to the girl; so he hitched her
as high as he could without the loss of a
steadying back-handed hold on her, stooped
forward slightly and went ahead at a fair
pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t talk; and evidently the young
woman had nothing to say. After a silent
mile he halted, and let his load slide gently to
the snow at his heels. They rested side by
side. He lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s easy,” he said. “We’ll make it handily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very strong,” she said. “And the
stronger a man is, the kinder he should be.
You are strong enough, and you should be
kind enough, to let kindness overrule your
pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride? I don’t know what you mean by
that, upon my word!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not proud?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. What of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad. Then you’ll go away to-morrow,
back to New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I explained all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is keeping you here but your
silly pride. You are too proud to allow people
like the Danglers, or a little thing like a
threat of death, to change your plans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong. I don’t want to go away,
that’s all. I want a horse, and I’m interested
in—in the country. And I can’t believe that
the Danglers would dare to go as far as that
even if they were able.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will think of a way—a safe way. I
mean it. I beg you to go away to-morrow!
Think of what life means to you—and those
who love you! This isn’t a war. There
would be nothing glorious in death here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And think of your wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t any—but it would be rough on
my mother, I’ll admit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rough on her? It would break her heart!
And the woman you love—who loves you—who
is waiting for you. Consider her feelings.
Doesn’t her happiness mean anything
to you? As much as your pride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van scratched his chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe there’s a great deal in what you
say, but what about your ankle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t be silly. I—this is serious—so
serious that—I want to cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that, for heaven’s sake! I’ll be sensible.
I’ll go away to-morrow. I’ll eat my
pride and all that sort of thing and beat it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see that it is the best thing for me
to do—from the point of view of the people
who love me so distractedly. I’ll run away
to-morrow—on one condition. You must
promise to keep me in touch with your ankle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is—mean—unworthy of a—man—like
you. Making fun. Cheating. I’m not—joking.
I want to—save you—and you think—I’m
a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! I’m the fool. I’m not joking.
I’ll go away and save my life if you will
promise to let me know about your ankle.
How it’s recovering day by day and that sort
of thing. That’s not asking a great deal—in
return for my eating my pride and permitting
you to save my life. Now I am serious. I
mean that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you give me your word of honor to
go to-morrow if I promise to—to put your
anxiety at rest about my ankle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you have my promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Please accept my word of honor
that I’ll skip out to-morrow. Now we had
better be toddling on our way again. Climb
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this isn’t fair—making you carry me.
No, it isn’t! It is cheating. I have your
promise—so I’ll keep my promise now. I—my—there
isn’t anything wrong with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With what? Your promise? Of course
not. Mine is all right too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean—I mean my ankle. There isn’t
anything—the matter with my ankle. I was—only
pretending.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Pretending? I see. At least that is
to say I hope to get an eye on it in a minute.
I seem to be unusually dull to-night—this
morning. You didn’t hurt your ankle. Is
that what you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I didn’t hurt it. I didn’t even fall
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s exceedingly amusing—as far as I can
see. You got a free ride; and if you don’t
mind, I don’t. But it seems hardly enough to
be so amazingly clever and deep about. The
ride is all you gained by it, so far as I can
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what had that to do with—well——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fastened on her snowshoes and led the
way. She kept up with him easily. He
turned his head now and again, as if to speak,
only to face front again in silence. At last
she came up beside him and touched his elbow
and asked if he were angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered. “I am doing my best,
but I don’t believe you have done anything
for me to be angry about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped you wouldn’t be. I played a trick
on you—but it was for your own good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get me to make you a promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So tricking me into toting you on my back
was part of that scheme?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I—knew I had to—interest you in
myself—so that you would pay attention to
my arguments. I thought that the more
trouble I was to you—well, I <span class='it'>had</span> to do something—to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did it. I am not angry, but pleased.
Do you mind if I ask if you have always
lived in the country around here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was away at school for a few years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped behind and silence was resumed.
It was maintained for nearly half
an hour; and then she came abreast of him
again and halted him with a hand on his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are,” she whispered. “Just
through there. Not thirty yards away. Good
night. And you will go to-morrow. So it is
good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took both her mittened hands in his and
stared hard at her upturned face, trying to
find something there for the discernment of
which the light was insufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” he said in guarded tones.
“And good morning; and, as I must go away
to-morrow, to-day, good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall soon be back—for that horse.
I promised a horse of that strain—to a girl.
That’s the only thing I’ve ever offered her
that she has accepted—so I can’t fall down
on that. But I’ll take precautions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please go, and stay away. They won’t
sell you a horse. They will kill you. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll chance it—in the hope that you will
save my life again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I won’t, if you do anything so crazy.
Don’t be a fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She snatched her hands out of his and
turned and vanished in the blackness of
crowded firs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane looked straight up between the black
spires of the forest and saw that the stars were
misty. He saw this, but he gave no heed to
it. He wasn’t worrying about the stars. He
turned and stepped along on the track which
Joe’s webs had already beaten twice and his
once. It was deep enough to follow easily,
heedlessly, despite the gloom. He felt exalted
and exultant. Even his anxiety, which
was entirely for the girl, thrilled him deliciously—such
was his faith in himself, and
his scorn of the Danglers. The thought of
going away on the morrow did not depress
him. He would soon be back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this high and somewhat muddled mood
he might easily have passed an elephant in
the blackness of the wood without sensing it.
As it was, he passed nothing more alarming
or unusual than poor Pete Sledge. Pete did
nothing to attract the other’s notice, and took
to the shadows behind him with no more
sound than the padded paws of a hunting
lynx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a little game that had grown dear
to Pete’s heart of late years. Natural talent
and much practice had made him amazingly
proficient at it. What he did not know of
the bodily activities of Robert Vane and Joe
Hinch during the past few hours was not
much; and it may be that he suspected something
of what was going on in their heads
and hearts. He had wanted to chuckle, had
been on the very verge of it, at the sight of the
stranger carrying the artful young woman on
his back—for he had known that there was
nothing wrong with her ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane had covered more than half of the
homeward journey at a moderate rate of speed
when he became conscious of the light touch
of a snowflake on his face. He was not particularly
interested, but for lack of something
better to do he halted and looked straight up
again. The high stars were veiled. Large,
moist flakes fell slowly. He produced a cigarette
and lit it, considering the effect of a
heavy snowfall on his plans for the immediate
future. The effect was nil, so far as he could
see. Which shows how little he knew about
his immediate future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He resumed his journey at a slightly better
pace, planning the morrow’s departure to the
nearest town and the best manner of his quickest
possible return. He would take precautions
of the Danglers, as he had promised,
but he must avoid involving the law if he
could think of a way. Why not bring a bodyguard
back with him, and thus supported,
beard the—! Hell! * &nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;* He pitched
forward at the blow, fumbling for an inner
pocket even as he fell. But he hadn’t a
chance. He was jumped, pounded deep in
the snow, bound at wrists and ankles, gagged
and blindfolded. He was yanked out roughly
and turned over; and that was all for a few
minutes. He heard a shrill whistle from
close at hand, and the softened answer; and
then, for a little while, he was left undisturbed
on his back. His nose and chin were exposed,
and on these he felt the snowflakes falling
faster and faster. He was slightly dizzy and
slightly nauseated, but his mind was clear.
His thick fur cap had saved him from a
knockout. He was not in pain, though his
discomfort was considerable; and he was
angry enough to bite. The Danglers had him,
he knew—and here was just and sufficient
cause for rage. The Danglers had tricked
him—and here was cause for shame. He had
been guilty of military error as old as warfare:
he had underrated the enemy. He was
a fool! No wonder the girl had been afraid
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he felt a fumbling at the thongs
of his snowshoes. The snowshoes were removed.
He felt a pair of hands under his
shoulders, another pair at his knees, and he
was lifted and carried. He strained his ears
to catch a voice, but in vain. He was roughly
handled—bumped and dragged. It was
quite evident to him that his captors were in
a hurry to get him to some particular spot, but
it seemed that they were utterly indifferent as
to his condition upon arrival. They carried
him feet first; and frequently the leader got
completely away from the other and his head
and shoulders were dropped with a smothering
thump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brief rests were frequent. Where the underbrush
was awkwardly dense, he was simply
dragged along by the feet. Now and then he
caught a whiff of strong tobacco smoke; and
later he caught a whiff of ardent spirits.
After many minutes of this, or perhaps an
hour—for with so many bumps and thumps
he found it useless to attempt the reckoning
of the passage of time—and after a less brief
halt than usual, his webs were replaced and
his ankles were freed, and he was stood upon
his feet. For a moment he contemplated the
advisability of delivering a few blind kicks—but
before he had arrived at a decision he was
pushed from the rear and flanks. He staggered
forward to save himself from falling
on his face; and before that initial stagger
was completed another well-timed and well-placed
thrust sent him staggering again; and
then another—and thus the journey was continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane found walking, even with tied hands
and bandaged eyes, pleasanter than being carried
like a sack of oats. But this did not improve
his temper. The gag hurt him, and
that nerve-racking experience of advancing
blindly against underbrush without any protection
for the face maddened him more and
more desperately at every step. And to be
forced to it! To be thumped and thrust along
from behind! An unusually violent poke with
something exceedingly hard—the butt of a
rifle, most likely—put the last straw on the
over-strained back of his discretion. He
turned with his right leg drawn up and shot
out his right foot with every ounce that was
in him, snowshoe and all. The blind blow
landed. A yowl went up and someone went
down. He jumped and landed on his mark,
stamped twice with all his weight, then turned
and jumped away. He missed his objective,
the other Dangler, by a few inches that time,
and received a bang on the ear for his trouble.
But he tried again—and again—and once
more. He fought furiously. He was blindfolded
and his hands were tied behind him,
but he came within an ace of victory. Despite
the odds against him, four minutes transpired
between his first jump and his last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he recovered consciousness he was
again being carried and dragged. After a
long time and many drops he was stood on
his feet again and hustled along. After as
much of that as he could stand up to, he fell
and refused to arise. From that to the finish
he was dragged, with an occasional lift over
a blow-down or some other natural obstruction
too high to take in an straight pull. He
lost consciousness again before the end of that
desperate and humiliating journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to himself the second time
it was to find the gag gone from his mouth,
the bandage gone from his eyes, and his hands
tied before him instead of behind him. He
was on a floor of poles beneath a broken roof
of poles and bark. Flashing snowflakes and
a flood of desolate gray light fell through the
hole in the roof. There was a hillock of
snow beneath the rent, and there were little
drifts of it elsewhere blown under and past
the warped door. The door was shut; and
nothing was to be seen of the men who had
brought him here, and he could catch no
sound of them from without, and there was no
sign of them within except the tracks of rackets
on the snowy floor. He wondered dully
at the meaning of these things. He was dizzy,
faint, and parched with thirst. He sat up
painfully and rested his shoulders against the
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened and a snow-whitened figure
entered on snow-weighted rackets. He
halted and peered around at the gloomy corners
of the hut. It was Joe Hinch, but Vane
didn’t believe his eyes. So he closed his eyes
and made an effort of will toward the clearing
and steadying of his brain, and wrenched desperately
at the cords with which his wrists
were bound. The cords loosened easily. His
right hand came free and then his left. But
still he kept his eyes closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His idea was that what he had seen was
either a vision created by his own battered
head or a reality transformed by his aching
eyes. If it were nothing but a vision, well
and good. If it should prove to be a reality,
then the chances were that it was one of his
enemies, in which case he would sit perfectly
motionless until the last moment, and then—well,
his hands were free now! He didn’t
feel up to a fight—but, by the Lord, he would
put up a fight! So he kept his eyes closed and
his ears open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard a low cry, a sob, a quick pad and
clatter of rackets on the snow-streaked floor,
a movement close beside him and quick, half-choked
breathing. He felt a hand on his face,
light and searching and tender. It was a small
hand. An arm slipped behind him and his
head was drawn to the hollow of a snowy
shoulder. But it was a soft shoulder. Then
he opened his eyes. His eyes had been right
the first time. He could not see her face now,
for it was pressed against his cheek. He
could see only a strand of dark, snow-powdered
hair like a veil close across his vision.
He no longer doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was praying—whispering a prayer
against his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t die,” she whispered. “Dear God,
don’t let him die! Don’t let him die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He trembled slightly. His arms were free
though benumbed. He slipped one around
her. He attempted to speak, but could not
articulate a single word. He managed nothing
better than a faint sigh. She drew gently
back from him, still crouched and kneeling
and not quite out of the embrace of his numbed
arm, and looked into his face. She looked
into his eyes. There were tears on her cheeks—tears
and melted snowflakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” she whispered; and then she
moved back from him and stood up and turned
away. She raised both hands to her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane moistened his dry lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They bagged me,” he said. “But what’s
their game? And where are we? And how
did you get here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came back to him and knelt again,
smiling tremulously and dabbing at her eyes
with wet fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to overtake you,” she said. “I
didn’t go home—only to the door—and then
I turned back. I felt that—I had been—rude.
And I was afraid. But I couldn’t catch up to
you before—you were attacked. They were
carrying you when I got near. I followed
them all the way, and hid until they went
away from here. I knew they wouldn’t kill
you. I knew they would leave you to die—lost—helpless—starved.
See these!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted his snowshoes from the floor for
his inspection. The tough webbing was torn
hopelessly from both frames.</p>

<h3>THE RAID</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was up when Pete Sledge knocked
on the kitchen door of Moosehead House.
The door was locked. He knocked with his
knuckles, then with a stick of stove-wood. It
was Jard who at last unlocked and yanked
open the door, but Miss Hassock wasn’t far
behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil?” cried Jard; and then, in
milder tones, “So it’s yourself, Pete! Glad
to see you, but what’s your hurry so early in
the mornin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got ’im!” exclaimed Pete. “They’ve
got the stranger—them Danglers. I seen it,
so I come a-jumpin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that? Who? What stranger?
Come along in here an’ set down an’ tell it
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sport. The lad with the trick pants.
The feller who drug Joe Hinch out of bed the
night of the fire. That’s who. I seen it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vane? Yer crazy! He’s in bed in this
house, or if he ain’t he’d ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better go see,” said Miss Hassock,
turning to the stove and setting a match to
the kindlings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard ran. Pete sat down. Jard returned
at top speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ain’t there!” he cried. “What was
that you said, Pete? When did it happen?
What did they do with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They picked him up, but I didn’t wait.
Reckon they’re totin’ him back to Goose
Crick this very minute. That’s where they’ll
hide him—till they think up some slick way
of losin’ him in the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Pete, you got this all straight now,
have you? You ain’t been dreamin’ or nothin’
like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool, Jard Hassock!” exclaimed
Liza. “You got to do something
now—simply got to—you and every man in
this village. If you don’t, there’ll be murder
done. Go tell the McPhees, and the
Joneses and the Browns and the Wickets and
the Haywards and the McKims and old man
Pike—the whole bunch. Get your guns and
pistols and light out for the Crick with a
couple of teams quick’s the Lord’ll let you!
But send Charlie McPhee, or some other lad
with a fast horse, to Jim Bell’s to fetch him
along too—and tell him to tell Jim to telephone
over to Lover’s Glen for the deputy-sheriff.
I’ll have coffee ready when you get
back, Pete, you go too and help Jard stir ’em
up. It’s got to be done this time, Jard—done
and done for good and all—so it’s no use you
scratchin’ your nose about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon ye’re right, Liza,” admitted Jard
reluctantly, “if Pete ain’t mistaken. But
durn that Vane! Out runnin’ the woods all
night, hey! Couldn’t he wait? Couldn’t
he keep still till I’d thought out a way?
Why the hell couldn’t he’ve let sleepin’ dogs
lay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out!” cried Liza. “Tell us that to-night.
I’ll load your gun while you’re gone
to scare up the men. Scare’s right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, Charlie McPhee set out
in a red pung, behind a sorrel mare, for Jim
Bell’s place a few miles below the village.
Mr. Bell was the nearest constable. Half an
hour after that again, two sleds set out for the
Dangler settlement on Goose Creek. Each
sled was drawn by a pair of horses, and
crowded with men armed with many kinds
and patterns of explosive weapons in their
pockets and their hands. Snow was falling
thick and soft and steady. There was not a
breath of wind. The bells had been removed
from the harness of both teams. The men
whispered together, and peered nervously
ahead and around into the glimmering, blinding
veils of the snow. They spoke with lowered
voices before the top of the hill was
reached, as if those dangerous Danglers could
hear their usual conversational tone across a
distance of seven miles. They were not keen
on their errand, not even the most daring and
independent of them—but Liza Hassock had
driven them to it. Liza had talked of murder,
disgrace, and cowardice. She had threatened
the most reluctant with ridicule, the law
and even physical violence. She had sneered
and jeered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know your reasons for hanging back,”
she had cried. “I know what’s at the bottom
of all this ‘live and let live’ slush you’ve been
handing out. One’s a reason of the heart—and
that’s saying you’re afraid of the Danglers,
that you’re cowards! An t’other is a
reason of the gullet. Oh, I know! Now I’ll
tell you men straight what’s going to happen
if you don’t all crowd up to Goose Crick and
save Mr. Vane. I’ll go to Fredricton, and if
that’s not far enough I’ll go to Ottawa, and
I’ll put such a crimp into that gin-mill up to
Goose Crick that you’ll all be back to drinking
lemon extract again, including Deacon
Wicket. That’s what will happen! That
will fix the moonshining Danglers, and then
you’ll have to go farther and pay more for
your liquor. That’ll fix ’em!—the whole
b’ilin’ of them; murderers and moonshiners
and bootleggers and all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Liza had won. Even Deacon Wicket had
joined the rescue party with a double-barrelled
shotgun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jard Hassock drove the leading team. The
big, mild horses jogged along without a suspicion
of the significance of their errand.
Perhaps they wondered mildly why so numerous
a company rode each ample sled—but it
isn’t likely. Certain it is that they did not so
much as guess that they were taking part in
an historic event, lending their slow muscles
and big feet to the breaking of a century-old
tyranny, bumping forward through the obscuring
snow to the tragedy that was to flash
the modest names of Forkville and Goose
Creek before the eyes of the world. Well,
what they didn’t know, or even suspect, didn’t
hurt them. Perhaps they missed the cheery
jangle of their bells, and so sensed something
unusual in their morning’s task—but if so
they showed no sign of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leading team drew up at the nearest
Dangler farmhouse and the second team
passed on silently toward the second house.
Jard opened the kitchen door, and beheld
Jerry Dangler and his wife and children at
table eating buckwheat pancakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen anything of a stranger round here
named Vane?” asked Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope,” replied Jerry. “Never heard tell
of him. What’s he done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got himself in a nasty mess, an’ there’s
a bunch of us out a-lookin’ for him. He’s
been hit on the head an’ drug away somewheres.
We got to hunt through your house
an’ barn, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to it. You won’t find no stranger here.
I’ll show you round the barns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You set right there an’ go ahead with your
breakfast, Jerry. Sammy, you keep an eye on
him, and see that he don’t disturb himself.
Hold your gun like this. That’s right. But
don’t shoot onless you got to. Hunt around,
boys. Four of you out to the barn. Upstairs,
some of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Sledge was not in evidence among the
searchers. He had slipped from the sled and
vanished into the murk of snowfall, all unnoticed,
just before the house had been
reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first farmstead was searched without
success. The men of the second team drew a
blank at the second house. Jard and his crew
drove on to the third house of the settlement.
There he found a Dangler with two grownup
sons and a hang-over; and but for his firmness
there would have been a fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got you cold, boys,” said Jard. “We
mean business. Set still an’ be good or there’ll
maybe be a funeral you ain’t figgerin’ on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The retort of the householders sounded bad,
but there was nothing else to it. Young McPhee
and the constable drove up at about this
time. The snow was still spinning down
moist and thick through the windless air. The
searchers went from house to house, appearing
suddenly out of the blind gray and white
weather at the very door, as unexpected as unwelcome.
No warning passed ahead of them.
Even old Luke Dangler was caught in his
sock-feet, smoking beside the kitchen stove,
all unbraced and unready. When he realized
the nature of Jard’s visit and the futility of
physical resistance, the swift darkening of his
eyes and the graying pucker of his mouth
were daunting things to behold. He denied
all knowledge of the whereabouts or fate of
the stranger. He denied it with curses which
caused profound uneasiness to the spirits of
several of Forkville’s substantial citizens.
Doubts assailed them as to the soundness of
Miss Hassock’s judgment and the wisdom of
their course. They wondered if the life of
any one stranger could possibly be worth the
risk they were taking. They and their fathers
had put up with the habits and customs of the
Danglers of Goose Creek for over one hundred
years. This attitude had acquired the
dignity of a tradition. Was it wise to break
with tradition now on the question of whether
or not a stranger in trick pants and a fancy
mackinaw were dead or alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing of Vane was discovered on or about
old Luke’s premises. Then the deputy sheriff
of the county appeared suddenly in the
midst of the searchers. He drew Jard Hassock
aside and asked for a description of the
missing stranger. Jard complied; and the
official nodded his head alertly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s him, for sure,” he said. “The gent
from Ottawa. I’ve been kinder expectin’
him down this way a long time. Big man.
One of the biggest. We got to find him, Jard—an’
what he come lookin’ for, too. This is
serious. Old Luke Dangler guessed right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on your life he didn’t! I know Vane.
He’s half New York an’ half London. He
come to buy a horse of the old Eclipse strain
of blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, you’re easy! You don’t know the big
fellers, Jard. Maybe’s he’s from New York
and London, but that don’t say he ain’t from
Ottawa, too. This outfit’s been picked to be
made a horrible example of, that’s what—so
I reckon it’s about time for me to start in
doin’ my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the deputy sheriff, fired with professional
zeal which burned all the more fiercely now
for having so long lain dormant, searched for
more than the missing stranger, while the constable
and the men of Forkville stood guard
over the men of Goose Creek. The hog-house
had only one chimney—but the deputy sheriff
discovered a secret door, and a second lead
running into that chimney, and a distillery
at the foot of the second lead. Not content
with that, he went ahead and found whisky
from Quebec in the haymows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Luke Dangler was handcuffed. His
tough old heart came within an ace of clicking
off with rage at the indignity of it. The
firearms from all the houses of the settlement
were confiscated. The men were counted and
the tally was found to be two short. Henry
Dangler and his son Steve were missing.
Everyone denied all knowledge of their
whereabouts. More than this, the young
woman called Joe could not be found. When
old Luke was questioned about her, he answered
with inarticulate snarls of his gray
lips and a flicker of derision and hate from
his darkened eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaders were in old Luke’s house, and
the crowd stood in front of it, with sentries
posted all around it. Amos Dangler stood
in the door, jeering. Snow continued to spin
down from the low gray clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got to find Vane,” said Jard Hassock.
“They’ve drug him back somewhere—to lose
him. That’s your old game, Amos. I don’t
give a damn about this rum, but we got to
find the stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My game!” sneered Amos. “You say so
now, do you—an’ scart to open yer mouth for
nigh onto twenty years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about Joe,” queried one of the
McPhees. “I reckon she’s the one we’re
worryin’ about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s run back to old Dave Hinch, that’s
what she’s done,” said Jard. “Nobody’s tryin’
to lose her. But it’s good night to Vane if
we don’t find him before dark. We’d best
scatter an’ hunt the woods. I know their dirty,
sneakin’ tricks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know, Jard Hassock?” asked
Amos, stepping from the doorway and advancing
slowly upon the proprietor of Moosehead
House. “You’ve found yer tongue all
of a suddent, hey? Well, it’s a dirty tongue—an’
I don’t like it—an’ I’m a-goin’ to knock it
down yer dirty throat, along with yer teeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s fightin’ talk,” said Jard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be no fightin’ here, Amos Dangler!”
exclaimed the constable. “You git back
there into the house, Amos—an’ you keep
quiet, Jard. The law’ll do all the fightin’
that’s got to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men closed in upon the angry voices, hoping
that Amos and Jard might clash with
fists and teeth despite the professional attitude
of the constable. They wanted to see a fight.
They saw more than enough of that sort of
thing to last them a lifetime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete Sledge appeared from the obscurity of
the weaving snow. He had been forgotten by
all. He jumped in between Jard Hassock
and Amos Dangler. He had an axe in his
hands. Amos retreated a step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! Didn’t I kill you once, long
ago?” cried Pete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In yer eye,” sneered Amos, fumbling at the
front of his coat with an unmittened hand.
“It’s daytime, you poor nut! Run home to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I killed you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe—in yer mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pete’s arms twitched even as Amos Dangler’s
right hand came away from the front
of his coat. The axe flew even as the automatic
pistol spat a red jab of flame. The axe
struck and the pistol spat again in the same
instant of time. Dangler staggered backward
and screamed before he fell, but poor Pete
Sledge dropped without a sound. That was
the end of that old trouble—unless it has been
continued elsewhere, beyond the field of vision
of Forkville and Goose Creek.</p>

<h3>THE WAY OUT</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Far away in the broken hut in the snow-blinded
forest, Robert Vane gazed in perplexity
at the useless webs which Joe held up
for his inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did I do that?” he asked. “I don’t
remember anything of that sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t do it,” she answered. “It was
done by the Danglers—my relatives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t understand. And why did they
leave me here—with the cord at my wrists so
loose that I slipped my hands free? Why
didn’t they do me in for keeps, if they feel
that way about me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl let her snowshoes fall with a clatter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did for you,” she said. “They knew
nothing about me. When they tore the webbing
they killed you as surely as if they had
cut your throat—as far as they knew. You
have no compass, no food, no matches, no
blankets, no snowshoes—nothing. You are
weak—for they have hurt you. You are lost—and
the snow is deep and still falling. You
are lost. They lost you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. You have saved my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the way out; and I have matches,
but nothing to eat—and nothing to mend
your rackets with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About seven miles to the nearest clearing—by
the right way. By any other way—hundreds
of miles! But I know the right
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven miles. That’s not far. Two hours—or
so. When shall we start? But you must
be tired out. Of course you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe I’d know the marks in this
storm. It will thin up in a few hours, I think.
Are you feeling better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right as rain,” he said, scrambling to his
feet. He staggered a step, stood swaying and
propped an arm to the nearest wall for support.
He misjudged the distance, or the
length of his arm, and would have fallen but
for her. She sprang to him, embraced him
and eased him to the floor. “But still a trifle
dizzy,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crouched beside him, with a shoulder
to steady him, but with her face averted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any chance of their returning to see how
I am doing?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “They are too clever
for that,” she replied. “They will go to the
village, and then home. People will see them
and talk to them. They have traveled away
from here as fast as they could, and left everything
to—to nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a man doesn’t starve to death in a few
hours, nor in a few days. Suppose I simply
sat here until a search-party found me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone? As they intended. Without fire?
You would freeze to death before a search-party
was thought of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt in all his pockets. “That’s right,”
he said. “All my matches are gone, and my
pistol and ammunition—but they’ve left my
cigarettes. Without a single match, confound
them! But what if I had struck right out and
happened on the right way? That would
have upset their calculations, I imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The snow is deep; to your hips, in places—and
deeper. Even if you happened on the
right way, and happened to keep it in this
storm—which could not be—you would have
no chance. Weak, and without help, and
without a fire to rest by! You could not travel
half of seven miles. But I have matches;
and I know the way. I can help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need help, heaven knows!” he said.
“And I’m glad it is you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a silence of several seconds she replied,
“I’m glad, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left him, gathered some old boughs
from a bunk, tore strips of bark from the
logs of the wall and made a fire on the rough
hearth. She tore poles from the fallen patch
of roof, broke the smaller of them, and fed
them to the fire. She helped him over to a
corner near the hearth and gave him a match
for his cigarette. She had plenty of matches,
a large jack-knife and hairpins in her pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can stand a lot of this,” said Vane. “The
men who thought they could kill me this way
are fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joe searched about the hut, found a rusty
tin kettle at last and went out into the spinning
snow. Vane felt a chill, whether physical
or spiritual he did not know, the moment
the warped door closed between them. He
got to his feet, moved unsteadily and painfully
to the door and pulled it open. He saw
her through the veils of the snow descending
the cleared slope before the hut and watched
the slender figure until it melted into a dark
screen of alders. His legs and arms ached;
his ribs and head were sore; and his throat
ached and his lips were parched; but his heart
was elated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned with the kettle full of chips
of ice which she had hacked from the surface
of the brook with her knife. She melted this
at the fire and cooled it in the heap of snow
under the break in the roof. They drank it
together, turn and turn about. Vane felt
much better for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s queer to think that you wasted all
that game with your ankle,” he said. “All
that effort to make me promise to run away—all
that successful effort—thrown away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And worse than thrown away,” she answered.
“If I hadn’t done that perhaps you
would not have been ambushed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you tricked me into carrying you
on my back,” he returned gravely. “I don’t
regret the ambush, the bump on the head, the
thumps and kicks—anything. The fact
is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you promised a horse to that
young lady?” she interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. How did you guess? And her
brother bet a thousand dollars I wouldn’t
find anything of the blood of Eclipse in these
woods. But all that doesn’t matter. It all
seems rather idiotic to me now. The real
meaning of all this—of my coming to this
country—is—well, I struck town just in time
to pull you out of a fire, didn’t? And I didn’t
even stop to take a look at what I had saved!
Good Lord! And now you are saving my
life; and even horses of the blood of Eclipse
don’t seem so important to me now. It can’t
be just chance that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you forgetting something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear! I haven’t forgotten a word you
have said, nor a single——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your mother—and the woman you
promised the horse to!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall give her the horse, if I get it. But
it doesn’t matter much, either way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You asked her to be your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twice, I believe—but she said she
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wouldn’t! Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should she? I’m poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor? And yet you wagered one thousand
dollars that you’d find a horse of a certain
strain of blood up here in these woods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sporting bet; and I have a thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you love her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong. I thought I did, once or
twice—or thought I thought I did. It was
all a matter of thinking, as I see it now. But
it doesn’t matter. Do you—are you—do you
love someone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love somebody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think? Don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you happy about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it wise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t think so. I’m sure it is
not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God! That fellow who came to see
me! That—that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steve Dangler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that? Do you think I love
Steve Dangler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But haven’t you just said so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head and turned her face
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, please,” he whispered. “It’s
your duty to forgive me, don’t you know—for
I saved your life and you are saving mine.
Joe, please look at me. It is your own fault
that I—well, why did you pretend to hurt
your ankle? Is it fair to walk miles and
miles after a man in the woods at night, to
save his life, and then to be angry with him
for—for telling you the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What truth have you told me?” she asked
unsteadily, still with averted face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the dearest person in the world!
You are the——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got swiftly and lightly to her feet,
crossed to the door and opened it, then stood
looking out. Vane sighed. Presently the
girl turned, but she did not look at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is thinning,” she said. “I think we had
better make a start now. It is clear enough
for me to see the landmarks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fastened on her rackets, and picked up
the rusty kettle. Vane buttoned his outer
coat, drew on his mittens, pulled his cap down
about his ears and hoisted himself to his feet.
“I’m ready,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stepped out into the thinning snowfall,
glanced back, glanced around, then
moved off slowly. Vane followed. He stepped
from the threshold and sank to his knees.
His next step sank deeper. He plunged
ahead, conscious of a protest from every bone
in his body. But that did not dismay him.
He had lifted his feet before against protests.
His head felt clear now, and that was a great
thing; and his heart felt like a strong engine
in perfect running order. As for his bones,
he was sure that none of them was broken. So
he plowed forward in the tracks of the girl’s
narrow webs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended the little clearing, and entered
the screen of alders along the brook.
The snow took him to the hips there, and
deeper. He plunged, stuck, plunged again
and plowed through. The girl turned and
watched his efforts for a few seconds with
veiled eyes, then turned to her front again,
and passed across the brook. Vane staggered
in the shallower snow of the brook, fell to
his hands and knees and came up again in a
flash. He set his teeth and struggled forward.
Halfway up the opposite bank he stuck fast.
He struggled without a word. It was no use;
so he rested, without a word. Joe came back
to him and, without looking at him, took his
hands and pulled him forward. He seconded
her efforts ably, and was soon through that
drift. She withdrew one hand from his grasp,
but he kept hold of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid you had changed your mind,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have,” she answered coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not! You came back and pulled
me out. You still mean to save my life, evidently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that! Yes, I’ll save your life”—and
she snatched her hand away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane followed again. His heart didn’t feel
so high now. In fact, it felt far worse than
his knees and shoulders and ribs. He thought
back and wondered at his dear companion of
the hut as if at some beautiful experience of
his childhood. He made one hundred yards,
two hundred, two-fifty, before striking another
drift. He struggled with the drift in a
desperate silence. He got halfway through.
She turned and came back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right,” he said. “With you in two
ticks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She searched for his hands, but his were
not extended in response. She came closer
and pulled at his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can manage it, thanks all the same,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know you can’t!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He squirmed free of her hands and clear of
the drift, leaving her behind him. But her
tracks were still in front for a distance of
twenty yards or more; so he plowed his way
onward without a backward glance. She ran
past him and again led the way. He followed—but
he fell at last, all in. He felt her arms,
her hands. She was trying to raise him from
the smothering snow. He pulled himself to
his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do it—thanks,” he said. “I must
rest—a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t look at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now take my hands,” she said, after a few
minutes of silence and inaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can manage it, thanks all the same,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t! You must let me help
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—what else can you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other thing—whatever it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall light a fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m warm enough, thank you, but if you’ll
give me a few of your matches I’ll be tremendously
obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him matches without a glance,
and then went away. He lit a cigarette.
Presently she reappeared, carrying bark and
dry brush. She dug a hole in the snow and
lit a fire at the bottom of it. Using a racket
for a shovel, she enlarged the hole around
the fire into a considerable hollow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is turning colder,” she said. “You must
come in here until you are rested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed slowly, painfully. She placed
a few green fir boughs for him to sit on, and
a few beside him for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has almost stopped snowing,” she said.
“If a wind comes up it will drift frightfully,
and that will be worse than the snowfall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far have we come?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly a mile,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would go on alone,” he said.
“Without me you’d do it before the wind
rises; and then, if you should happen to see
Jard Hassock or someone who wouldn’t mind
coming back for me, he’d find me waiting
right here—if it isn’t too much trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble!” she cried, turning a stricken,
outraged look at him; and then she hid her
face in her hands and shook with sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped an arm around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you turn on me?” he asked. “In
the hut you were—very kind. Why did you
change—and treat me like a dog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She continued to hide her face and sob. His
arm tightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said you were the dearest person in
the world,” he continued. “You are—to me.
You are the dearest person in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—have no right—to say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then whoever has a right to stop me had
better make haste. I love you, Joe! Make
the worst of that. I love you! Now run
away and leave me sticking here in the snow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—the woman who sent you—after a
horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless her for that! She was kinder to me
than she intended to be. Look at me, Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him.</p>

<h3>DEEP TRAILS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>They put a mile and a half between that
fire and the next. Vane was no longer
weakening. He was strengthening in heart,
muscles and spirit gradually but steadily,
despite the drag of the snow on his legs and a
decided sense of neglect under his belt. He
was working back to the pink of condition,
throwing off at every forward step something
of the effects of his difficult journey with the
Danglers. He was recovering by those very
efforts which his enemies had reckoned on to
work his undoing. But the young woman was
tiring. It was Vane who gathered fuel and
cleared away the snow and built the third
fire. They rested there for twenty minutes,
seated close together. She snuggled her head
against his shoulder and slept a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snowfall had ceased by that time, the
close gray blanket of cloud had thinned everywhere,
had been lifted from the horizon at
one corner, and now a desolate and subdued
illumination seeped across the white and black
world. The air, still motionless, was now dry
and bitterly cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the third stage of their homeward
journey, Joe dragged her snowshoes heavily,
and her pulls on Vane’s hands became feebler
at every drift. She was sleepy, bone-tired and
weak with hunger. Backwoods girl though
she was, she was not seasoned to hardship as
was her companion. But she continued to
recognize the landmarks of the right way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their halts and little fires fell more and
more frequently and closer and closer together.
At last a bitter lash of wind struck
and sent a thin wisp of snow glinting and running
like spray. They came upon a narrow
wood road well beaten by hoofs and bob-sled
shoes beneath the four-inch skim of new snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?” asked Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed. “Straight to Larry Dent’s
place,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he removed her webs, crouched and
hitched her up on his back. She made no
protest. “This is how I save your life,” she
said, and instantly closed her eyes in sleep.
Her arms were about his neck. They clung
tight even in her sleep. Her cheek was
against his ear. He staggered several times,
but he hadn’t far to go. As he reached the
kitchen door—the only door—of Larry Dent’s
little gray habitation, an icy wind swooped
down from the shuddering treetops and filled
the whole world with a white suffocation of
snow. He pushed open the door, staggered
across the threshold, and stumbled to his
knees at the large feet of the dumbfounded
Mrs. Dent, with his precious burden still
secure and asleep on his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See what’s blew in,” said Larry, who was
seated beside the stove smoking his pipe. “Shet
the door,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joe awoke and slipped from Vane’s shoulders.
Vane remained on hands and knees,
breathing deep. Mrs. Dent pulled herself
together, went over, and shut the door against
the flying drift. Larry shook the ashes from
his pipe, and said. “Glad to see you, Miss
Hinch; an’ also yer friend—or is he a hoss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Joe began to laugh and cry; and, still
laughing and crying, she ran to Vane and
helped him into a rocking chair, and kissed
him again and again right there in front of
the Dents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having left the stranger in the hut with the
broken roof, bruised and unconscious and fatigued,
without food or water or blankets or
matches or snowshoes, in complete ignorance
of the one right way of a hundred wrong ones
of escape from that place, Henry Dangler
and his big son Steve made straight for Forkville.
The snow blotted out their tracks behind
them. They visited half a dozen places
in the village, including two stores, the forge
and the hotel, and were puzzled to encounter
only women and children. They asked where
the men had gone to, and were puzzled by the
answers of the women and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s somethin’ wrong,” said Hen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sure looks like it,” agreed Steve. “That
dang old Hassock woman had a mean slant
to her eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They headed for the settlement on Goose
Creek with a growing uneasiness in their
tough breasts. They took the road, for it
was the shortest way. The new snow had
filled up the tracks of the sleds and also of the
pung in which young McPhee had brought the
constable. They hadn’t gone far before they
were startled by a jangle of silvery bells close
behind them, sounding suddenly out of the
muffling now. They leapt aside into the underbrush
and crouched and turned. They
saw a large man, white as wool, slip by in a
pung behind a long-gaited nag. He was there
and past in a dozen seconds. He had sat
hunched forward as if bowed by the weight
of snow on him. He had not looked to the
right or the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deputy sheriff,” whispered Henry to
his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell!” whispered Steve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we were too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess so. What’ll we do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon I’ll go along an’ see what’s happened.
Maybe the old man will trick ’em
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You best come back with me, pa. I jist
thought of somethin’ that’ll maybe work out
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back where to? What you thought of,
Steve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back to where we left that feller, an’ save
his blasted life! He ain’t seen us, nor heard
our voices. He don’t know who beaned ’im
and drug ’im around. Let’s go back an’ save
his damn life and git in right with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use, Steve! He’d be lost an’ froze
dead before we could git there—even if we
could find him. He’s the kind will bust right
out of the hut the minute he gits his wits back—right
out into the storm on his busted rackets—an’
git to runnin’ around in a circle inside
ten minutes. That’s his kind. Mind how
he jumped us, an’ him tied an’ blindfolded?
A fightin’ fool! When he sticks in a drift
he’ll tear the woods to pieces—an’ himself.
We’d be too late, Steve. Reckon we best forgit
all about that business. Reckon we’re in
for trouble enough without goin’ back an’
foolin’ around that section of the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess he won’t—I guess he’s tougher’n
you figger on. I’m goin’ back, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Steve headed back for the hut with the
broken roof by the shortest way through the
blinding curtains of moist snow. Steve was a
smart woodsman under normal conditions—but
now the conditions were not normal.
Never before had he traveled far in so thick
a fall of snow. Never before had he undertaken
a journey alone with panic in his heart
and doubt in his mind. He had gone a mile
before being conscious of the panic and the
doubt. After that, they grew with devilish
rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steve didn’t find the hut wherein he and his
father had left the stranger. He didn’t come
within miles of it. At last the snow ceased
to fall; and soon after that—or was it an hour
after?—he came upon a hole in the snow and
the ashes and black sticks of a spent fire in
the bottom of the hole. The ashes were still
warm. These things puzzled and frightened
him. He gave up all thought of finding the
hut. He walked for a long time, walked
meaningless miles, beneath a clearing sky,
looking for familiar landmarks. Suddenly a
bitter wind swooped down and filled earth
and sky with flying snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dent put Joe to bed. The girl fell
into a deep sleep—but she woke up a little
later for long enough to drink and eat from
a bountiful tray and answer a few of Mrs.
Dent’s eager and illuminating questions.
Robert Vane took a few snatches of sleep in
the rocking chair, and talked and smoked and
drank tea between naps. He answered questions
as they came, without thought or care.
He felt fine. He loved the whole world, but
this part of it more than the rest of it. And
when supper was ready he pulled his chair
up to the table, and drank coffee as if he had
never heard of tea, and ate buckwheat pancakes
and fried pork and hot biscuits and
doughtnuts and Washington pie. There was
nothing the matter with Robert Vane. Everything
was right with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind swished around the corners of
the little house, harsh and heavy with its
burdens of dry snow. It slashed the roof and
lashed the blinded windows and shouldered
the door. It whistled in the chimney and
under the eaves; and from the surrounding
forest came the muffled roar of it like surf
along a reef.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” exclaimed Mrs. Dent. “What was
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind,” said Larry. “Did you expect
a brass band?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old dog got onto his feet and cocked an
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rover heard it. There it is again! Hark!
Like someone yellin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry went to the door and pulled it open.
Wind and snow leapt in, the fire roared in the
stove, the flame of the lamp jumped high and
vanished and the old dog cowered back under
the table and howled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut that door!” screamed Mrs. Dent; and
Larry shut it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane struck a match, and lit the lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear anything but the wind,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess that’s what it was, all right—but
it sure did sound like someone hollerin’, once
or twice,” said the woman.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap11'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h3>THE PURCHASE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The luck of the Danglers went wrong all
at once. They got what was due them and
overdue them suddenly and swiftly, no mistake
about that! Old Luke and two others
were caught in the coils of the law with
enough loops over them to hold them for
years, and the still and the stock were confiscated.
Old Luke had money, but it availed
him nothing now. And Amos was dead—and
none the less so because poor Pete Sledge’s
queer life had also suffered a violent and sudden
conclusion. And young Steve Dangler
was missing. Steve had been last seen by his
father, on the day of the raid, on the road between
Forkville and Goose Creek. Days
passed without further sign of him or any
word of him. Even Miss Hassock was sorry
for the Danglers. Though she believed that
nothing was too bad for them, she felt that
this deluge of disaster might better have been
thinned over a period of several years, thus
offering opportunities for remorse and perhaps
for reform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Vane, the engine which had been
selected by fate for the undoing of the Danglers,
did not permit pity for the men who had
plotted his death to halt his activities. The
obstacles to his inspection of old Luke’s
stables having been removed with the removal
of the old breeder, Vane went ahead in that
matter, advised by Jard. They did business
with an elderly spinster, a daughter of Luke’s,
who had the old ruffian’s power-of-attorney,
but none of his pride in, and jealousy of, the
horses of the ancient strain. They found several
bays with white legs among the fast ones,
and selected a colt going on three, after a
searching examination. The price was four
hundred dollars, which Vane paid with banknotes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ what about the pedigree?” asked Jard.
“The old man kept a stud-book, for I’ve seen
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He took it away with him,” said Miss
Dangler. “If you want that colt’s pedigree
you gotter go to jail for it.” She scowled at
Vane defiantly, then turned suddenly and
burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane was sorry for her, but he couldn’t
think of a word of comfort to say to her. He
was embarrassed. He looked to Jard for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t take on about that,” said Jard
in a soothing voice. “There’s worse places
than jail, Miss Nancy, an’ there’s been better
men in jail than Luke Dangler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason which was not clear to
Vane, these words quieted the woman. She
dried her eyes with the back of a large hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon ye’re right, Jard Hassock,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the colt turns out half as well as I expect
him to, he’s worth more than four hundred,”
said Vane; and, before Jard could stop
his hand, he slipped another bill to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’ll show you the book,” she said,
yet more softened. “But what’s the use of a
pedigree, young man? Why d’you want
somethin’ with a colt you don’t ask for with
a human? They tell me you be lookin’ to
marry Joe Hinch—my own niece, an’ own
blood granddaughter to old Luke Dangler
an’ old Dave Hinch! Now what kinder pedigree
d’ye call that, mister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She hasn’t asked for mine, and I don’t give
a damn if all her grandparents are devils!”
exclaimed Vane. “I know her—and she’s
what I want!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Dangler smiled for the first time. “I
reckon ye’re right,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day of the great adventure in the
snowstorm, Joe had promised to marry Robert
Vane in two weeks’ time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joe lived at the McPhees now, with her
Grandfather Hinch; and Vane, still the occupant
of the state chamber of Moosehead
House, spent charmed hours of every day and
evening with her. She had dropped the last
shred of doubt of his sincerity during the last
few hours of their battle toward Larry Dent’s
sheltering roof. They argued sometimes as
to which had saved the other’s life that day,
only to agree that neither could have won
through alive without the heroic devotion of
the other. The days and nights slipped along
like enchantment toward the great day. Vane
lived in a world as new as dawn to him, a
world which he had sometimes in the past
vaguely suspected and vaguely longed for, a
world unlike anything he had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One midnight, having returned from the
McPhees’ at ten o’clock and yarned with
Jard for an hour and then smoked alone by his
fire for another hour, Vane was startled from
his reveries by the slow and silent opening of
his door. He got lightly to his feet. A man
entered, and cautiously shut the door. It was
an old man, bent a trifle at knees and neck,
broad-shouldered and white-bearded, wearing
an old felt hat pulled low over the forehead.
He was a stranger to Vane. He laid
a finger on his lip and advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” asked Vane. “And
who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so loud!” cautioned the other in a
horse whisper. “I ain’t come for any harm—but
there’s no call to wake up Liza Hassock.
’Scuse me if I set down. I’m Luke
Dangler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane pointed him to a chair, and resumed
his own seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were in jail in Fredericton,”
he said, in guarded tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I was, but I got out an’ run for it. I
been home to Goose Crick. Now look-a-here,
mister, was one of my horses what you come
onto this country after? Tell me that now,
straight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to try to buy a horse of that strain
you breed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you know about that strain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty. I know all about Willoughby
Girl, that English mare that was stolen from
an Englishman ninety-nine years ago. She
was a granddaughter of Eclipse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she now? Where’d you l’arn all
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I learned all that from my father, when
I was a small boy. I’m the grandson of the
man who brought Willoughby Girl to this
country, and lost her by theft. He hunted for
her over half the world—almost everywhere
but on Goose Creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sufferin’ cats! An’ you come lookin’ for
a bit of the old strain of blood! Why the hell
didn’t you say so first off? If you’d told me
who you was I’d believed you an’ sold you a
horse. But you be from the States, an’ the
gent who owned the English mare was an
Englishman! My pa told me so many’s the
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was your mistake—all your own fault!
As to my grandfather being an Englishman—why
not? We are all Americans now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell! Maybe a Dangler done yer gran’pa
a dirty turn a hundred years ago, but you’ve
squared that account with enough left over
and to spare to settle for twenty stolen mares.
There’s Amos dead—an’ where’s young Steve?
Here’s me in jail—or leastwise had oughter
be—an’ penitentiary awaitin’ me; an’ the
same for Ned an’ Benjamin an’ maybe for
two-three more. An’ there’s the business
shot to hell! An’ all because you come onto
this country to buy a horse, an’ didn’t
have courage enough to come an’ tell me the
truth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it amuses you to say so, go ahead. It
was my fault that two of your dirty cowards
ambushed me and knocked me senseless a
couple of times, and left me to die in the
woods, I suppose? Don’t be a fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it was yer fault! If you hadn’t been
drug off, that damn saphead Jard Hassock
wouldn’t have raised the village ag’in us, an’
the deputy sheriff—damn his eyes!—wouldn’t
have spied out the still an’ what not, an’ Amos
would be alive now, an’ so would young Steve,
an’ I’d be settin’ safe in my own house instead
of here tryin’ to make a deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A deal? What’s the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy says you want my pedigree book.
All right—an’ I want some money. She give
me a couple hundreds of what you paid her
for the colt—an’ a mean price that was paid,
mister! I need moren’t two hundred for to
make a gitaway, but I can’t touch a doller of
all my money, for it’s in the bank down to
Frederickton, an’ that’s where they cal’late
I’m in jail at. I’ll give you the pedigree book
for five hundred dollars. You couldn’t git
it for thousands, if it wasn’t that the police is
after me to put me back in jail, an’ I need the
money the worst way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dangler, you are hard-boiled. And you’re
a fool! Why do you imagine for a moment
that I’ll supply you with money to escape
with? Anything the law may hand to you
will be less than you deserve. If you were to
receive your deserts you’d be hanged for a
murderer. Hasn’t it occurred to you that
I’m much more likely to hand you back to
the police than to buy your stud-book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man smiled. “That would be a
hell of a way to treat Joe’s gran’pa!” he said.
“Wouldn’t it read rotten in the newspapers?
I could tell them reporter lads quite a lot
about pedigrees they don’t know yet, ‘Robert
Vane, New York sport, weds the great-granddaughter
of the thief who stole a horse from
his gran’pa. Mr. Vane of New York weds
Miss Hinch of Goose Crick. The bride’s
gran’pa an’ uncles wasn’t to the weddin’, bein’
in jail for moonshinin’ an’ bootleggin’ an’
murder.’ Say, wouldn’t it read great in the
newspapers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to it, Dangler! You haven’t got me
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man eyed him keenly, then produced
a notebook bound in oilcloth from an
inner pocket. He handed it to Vane. “There’s
the record back to the English mare of every
foal an’ filly me an’ my pa ever bred of that
old strain of blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vane glanced through the book, and saw
that this was probably so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s yer own,” said Luke Dangler. “But
I tell you ag’in you give Nancy a mean price
for the bay colt. Do I go back to jail, or
don’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go to hell, for all I care,” replied
Vane, calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanky, gran’son-in-law. Well, I’ll be
startin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment.” Vane dug into an inner
pocket, fingered crisp papers and passed four
hundred dollars to the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the colt is worth every cent of it,”
he said. “You know your way out. Good
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say! You’re a real sport! Thank God
you didn’t git lost in the woods that day?
Shake on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Luke Dangler extended his hand. Vane
overlooked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the window after you,” said Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the old rogue went. There was nothing
else for him to do.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap12'>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<h3>NO CHANCES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A bunch of belated letters arrived next
morning for Vane. They had been hung
up at the little town on the big river, where
the postmaster had mislaid the address for
forwarding which Vane had left with him.
Three letters were from his mother, three
from the lady whose indifference to and skepticism
concerning the backwoods descendants
of Willoughby Girl had stung him into making
the journey to Forkville—and who had
never before addressed so much as a scratch
of a pen to him—and several from several
firms of solicitors and attorneys. He read
them all before he went to see Joe. He found
Joe waiting for him, all ready for the morning
walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go out the Glen Road this morning,”
she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think we had better get married this
morning,” he said gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s for Thursday—day after to-morrow.
Had you forgotten? What’s the
matter, Rob?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do believe I’m afraid. I got some letters
to-day—and rather startling news. My
uncle and cousin are dead—killed in a railway
accident. It has put my wind up, I must
admit. And when I think of what you have
gone through even since I came to this place—that
fire, and the night and day in the woods—without
a scratch, I’m afraid our luck may
change any minute now. Why not to-day instead
of Thursday—and take no chances?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You afraid, Robert? No, it is only the
shock of the bad news. We have nothing to
fear. Were you very fond of your uncle and
cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But life’s a chancy thing. Yes, I liked
them. They were good fellows—both old
soldiers and all that sort of thing—and gone
like that, like nothing! Why wait until the
day after to-morrow, dear? Why drive my
luck? We’ll catch the parson at home, and
I have the license in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you serious, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead serious. I’m afraid to take a chance—for
the first time in my life. I never realized
before what a risky thing this is—this
being happy. My cousin was to be married,
you know. They were on their way to his
wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m sorry!” she cried. And then, “All
right, I’m ready,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They returned to the McPhees’ house three
hours later, man and wife. They found the
McPhees full of excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deputy sheriff jist drove through here
with old Luke Dangler,” said Tom McPhee
to Vane. “The old lad bust out of jail; an’ the
deputy caught him up on the Glen Road,
layin’ for someone with a gun. He’s cracked.
I reckon what done it was the sight of Amos
stoppin’ Pete Sledge’s axe with his face that
day. They won’t put him back into jail anyhow,
the deputy says. It’s the lunatic asylum
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was he gunning for on the Glen
Road?” asked Vane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what the deputy couldn’t make out.
The old lad was cussin’ about some feller
who’d busted up the whole works jist because
he didn’t have courage enough to tell who he
was an’ what he wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has no right to feel that way about it,”
returned Vane gravely. “It was coming to
him.”</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
